<p>Metallica is launching a national community service initiative dedicated to improving the communities that have been part of their journey for so many years. The band’s All Within My Hands foundation, launched last year, has declared May 23 as Metallica Day of Service, encouraging fans to go out and volunteer with local food banks to help fight nationwide hunger.</p>
<p>Last summer during their tour, the band contributed to local charity partners in each city they performed in including <a href="https://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Kids Rock</a>, <a href="https://www.grammy.com/musicares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusiCares </a>and <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America</a>. Now they’re encouraging people to get involved by volunteering in their communities.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://allwithinmyhands.org/blog/news/452442/join-all-within-my-hands-to-help-out-in-your-commu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of foodbanks here</a> and find one to volunteer with in your area. If those are out of reach, Metallica suggests visiting the <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America website</a> to find a nearby food bank. Volunteers who register to pitch in on Metallica’s Day of Service will be given an All Within My Hands t-shirt.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>Internet radio service <a href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank">Pandora</a> and national music education non-profit <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank">Little Kids Rock</a> have joined forces to bring free music lessons and instruments to kids at elementary and middle schools in Los Angeles, Oakland, Chicago and New York.</p>
<p>Pandora and Little Kids Rock kicked off the Modern Band music program in Los Angeles at Cienega Elementary School in south Los Angeles on September 25, and the streaming service plans to extend its support to other cities in the coming months.</p>
<p>An auditorium full of boisterous 4<sup>th</sup> graders rocked out with newly donated instruments including guitars, drum kits and amplifiers, and got their hands dirty doing arts-and-crafts projects including painting maracas and drawing on bandanas with Pandora volunteers.</p>
<p>For a dash of inspiration, French-Canadian singer-songwriter Couer de pirate performed a handful of songs for the kids, who screamed and cheered and asked her to sing in her native French. She obliged, and then performed her tune “The Way Back Home,&#8221; which she told the kids she had written for her 3-year-old daughter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-131.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-3801" title="photo 13" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-131-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-131-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-131-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-131.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>“We wanted to partner with Little Kids Rock to find a way to unleash the power of music in our community,&#8221; Marta Riggins, Pandora’s Director of Employee Experience and Marketing, told Music for Good. “Giving back is a part of our mission. It’s a great way for our employees to use their volunteer time, because they get 40 hours of time off each year to volunteer in their communities.”</p>
<p>Little Kids Rock music programs aim to offset diminishing budgets for music education in public schools by partnering with school districts in disadvantaged areas throughout the U.S. to train public school teachers in its innovative music curriculum while donating all of the instruments and resources necessary to run the music programs.</p>
<p>“It was a natural fit to team up with Pandora, because with their help we’ll be able to achieve a lot,” said Tony Sauza, Little Kids Rock regional program director for LA County. “It’s exciting to think of the potential.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Little Kids Rock is gearing up for a benefit show honoring Graham Nash, Steve Miller and Paul Shaffer at Manhattan Center on October 20. Click <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/2015benefit/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3237" title="alopress" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="221" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress.jpg 530w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /></a>By Billy Restivo</em></p>
<p>From Santa Barbara driveways to arenas and festivals all around the world, the guys in Animal Liberation Orchestra (ALO) have been infecting audiences with a vibrant, groovy rock that seems almost indigenous to their native Golden State. Now, after more than two decades and four studio albums together, they’re heading out on their Tour d’Amour, celebrating love, breezy tunes, old friends, and new faces.</p>
<p>In typical ALO fashion, the band will donate a portion of the proceeds from the tour – which will hit 11 cities throughout their home state of California – to non-profit organizations that work to bring music to children.</p>
<p>Music for Good caught up with vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Zach Gill to discuss just how far the group’s good vibes are spreading. Although the band has typically supported national organizations, those doing good work closer to home are never out of the question. “I think picking an actual school from our local zone just felt like a good fit,” says Gill, who helped name San Francisco’s Creative Arts Charter School the associated organization of Tour d’Amour IX.</p>
<p>As products of high school music programs themselves, Gill, along with bassist, Steve Adams, drummer, Dave Brogan, and guitarist, Dan “Lebo” Lebowitz now get the chance to help the Creative Arts Charter School provide hands-on, arts-integrated public education to Bay Area students.</p>
<p>“I was so happy when I found music because I wasn’t really too good at anything else,” Gill explains with a chuckle. “I don’t know what I would’ve done if I didn’t find music… and so I just feel like it’s good to give kids with a mind for that sort of thing the option and the outlet.”</p>
<p>Among the other organizations ALO have contributed to in the past are <a href="http://notesfornotes.org/" target="_blank">Notes for Notes</a>, which designs and equips after-school recording studios inside <a href="http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank">Little Kids Rock</a>, a group that provides free music classes and instruments to students across the country.</p>
<div id="attachment_3243" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3243" title="Jack &amp; ALO" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jack Johnson on stage with ALO</p></div>
<p>Gill and his bandmates have also worked closely in their philanthropic endeavors with longtime friend (and fellow UCSB graduate) Jack Johnson, whose organization, the <a href="http://johnsonohana.org/" target="_blank">Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation</a>, has made significant contributions to environmental, art, and music education worldwide. “I think there was always that [philanthropic] component to our music and Jack’s music,” says Gill. “If you’re going to get a bunch of people together, it’d be cool if it wasn’t just partying for partying sake.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s label, Brushfire Records, has also been pivotal to the band’s growth, according to Gill. Since the 2006 re-release of Fly Between Falls, Brushfire has put out three ALO albums and exposed international audiences to hits like “Girl, I Wanna Lay You Down” and “Blew Out The Walls.”</p>
<p>And so ALO continue to party for one good cause after another, leaving behind a rather contagious happy-go-lucky attitude every step of the way. One might ask what’s next for the California-born jam band vets; Gill’s thinking a new record (this autumn, possibly), more touring, and even a little benefit concert for a handful of lucky Santa Barbara grade-schoolers.</p>

<p>The events at Austin&#8217;s Flamingo Cantina featured an array of incredible performances by artists including Charli XCX, EMA, Future Islands, The Mary Onettes, We Were Promised Jetpacks, Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals and Neon Neon, Connan Mockasin and more.</p>
<p>During the parties, festival-goers had the chance to demo a new line of Orange Crush Pro Amps and participated in the Orange Gives campaign. Each time someone used the hashtag #OrangeGives on Twitter or Instagram and posted a photo of Orange gear on stage, Orange donated $1 to Little Kids Rock.</p>

<p>Thousands of people used the #OrangeGives hashtag, which resulted in a generous donation from Orange Amps to Little Kids Rock to support the non profit&#8217;s work providing free music education and instruments to kids in underserved areas across the U.S.</p>
<p>Renowned guitarist Monte Pittman, known for his work with Madonna, also came by to lend a hand and told the crowd about how he supports the work of Little Kids Rock. Check out some of the highlights below.</p>

<p><em></em>Renowned guitar amplifier manufacturer <a href="http://www.orangeamps.com/" target="_blank">Orange Amplification</a> is turning up the volume on free music education in schools to help offset nationwide budget cuts that are eliminating music programs in low-income communities across the U.S.</p>
<p>To help rectify this problem, the distinctive British amplifier brand has teamed up with national nonprofit <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank">Little Kids Rock</a> and <a href="http://m4gmedia.com/" target="_blank">M4G Media</a> to create the <strong>Orange Gives Campaign</strong>. Orange will donate $1 to Little Kids Rock every time someone posts to Twitter or Instagram using the hashtag<strong> #OrangeGives</strong> from March 12-16, 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Orange-Amp1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2508" title="Orange Amp" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Orange-Amp1-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Orange-Amp1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Orange-Amp1.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What&#8217;s more, anyone who includes the <strong>#OrangeGives</strong> hashtag along with a photo or video showing Orange gear – whether on stage at SXSW, in their home studio or with bands rocking out at a local club – will be entered into a drawing to win a premium Orange <a href="https://www.orangeamps.com/products/guitar-amp-heads/or-series/or15h-amp-head/" target="_blank">OR15 Amp Head</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the #OrangeGives campaign, Orange will give SXSW-goers the opportunity to demo gear at the Orange-sponsored Under the Radar day parties, March 12-14 from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Flamingo Cantina, 515 E. 6th Street, Austin. The parties are free and open to the public—no RSVPs or badges required.</p>
<p>Little Kids Rock is a national nonprofit that transforms children’s lives by restoring and revitalizing music education in under-served public schools. The organization partners with school districts to train public school teachers in their innovative curriculum while donating all of the instruments and resources necessary to run rockin’ music programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of music is Little Kids Rock,&#8221; says Alex Auxier, Artist Relations Manager for Orange Amplifiers. &#8220;Across the country music programs are losing financial support. Every lost dollar could mean another child never learns to play an instrument – a skill that can be vital to their well being. Orange Amps supports Little Kids Rock because we believe it is our obligation. Tag #OrangeGives and let’s create another generation of talented musicians together!”</p>
<p>Little Kids Rock counts several notable musicians among its supporters, including Metallica&#8217;s James Hetfield, Steven Van Zandt, Elvis Costello, Josh Groban, Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Kids Rock is thrilled to be partnering with Orange Amplifiers,&#8221; says Little Kids Rock Founder and Executive Director, David Wish. &#8220;Their support will help us turn up the volume in public schools across the country by bringing our free, rockin&#8217; music education program into their kids&#8217; lives!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://m4gmedia.com/" target="_blank">M4G Media</a> &#8212; the consulting arm of <a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/" target="_blank">Music for Good</a> &#8212; worked with Orange to create a campaign that would enable the historic brand to help one of their favorite causes while also giving people the chance to experience Orange&#8217;s distinctive amps.</p>

<p><em></em>A cacophony of sounds emanated from every corner of the Anaheim Convention Center, which could only mean that NAMM was in town. From pounding drums to strummed ukuleles and singers hitting high notes to demo sound equipment, this maddeningly delightful sensory overload takes place each year at none other than the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) four-day conference and trade show.</p>
<p>Thousands of musicians, instrument makers and gear-heads mixed, mingled and performed music while thousands of brands showed off their latest wares. Technology-driven music products, such as the Garritan Abbey Road CFX Concert Grand, featuring the Yamaha CFX Concert Grand piano recorded in London&#8217;s Abbey Road Studios’ historic Studio One, illustrated what the future of music will look like.</p>
<p>Several music-related charities were also on hand, spreading the word about their important work, ranging from offering kids the chance to record their own music for free in state-of the-art facilities to teaching them about the science of sound.</p>
<div id="attachment_2481" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/minimoog-sofa.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2481" title="minimoog-sofa" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/minimoog-sofa-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/minimoog-sofa-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/minimoog-sofa-1024x718.jpg 1024w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/minimoog-sofa.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Moog-Koussa gets comfy on a Minimoog sofa</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://moogfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Bob Moog Foundation</a>, which honors the legacy of electronic music pioneer Bob Moog, promoted its flagship program, Dr. Bob&#8217;s SoundSchool, which teaches second grade students the physics of sound using acoustic and electronic musical instruments such as the theremin and oscilloscopes. &#8220;We&#8217;re really proud because we&#8217;re serving 55 classrooms and over thousand kids,&#8221; Foundation director Michelle Moog-Koussa told Music for Good. &#8220;The program teaches kids about the basic physics of sound. We also train second grade teachers so we&#8217;re educating two generations at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, staff from <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank">Little Kids Rock</a>, a renowned non-profit that provides free music education and instruments to kids in schools in underserved areas throughout the country, met with members of the music industry to further their cause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/John-Lennon-Bus.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2482" title="John-Lennon-Bus" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/John-Lennon-Bus.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The<a href="http://www.lennonbus.org/" target="_blank"> John Lennon Educational Tour Bus</a>, which has become a regular fixture at NAMM, was parked outside the convention center offering tours to kids, musicians, and anyone interested in getting a glimpse of its state-of-the-art recording facilities. This non-profit mobile recording studio offers students the chance to write and record music with top-notch equipment and music professionals at no charge.</p>
<p>“We’re at NAMM to promote our idea and get musicians involved in supporting the bus,” engineer/producer said Hans Ages. “It’s a free space where kids can be completely creative. It’s a ripe environment for inspiration!”</p>
<p>NAMM also hosted several educational sessions for attendees, and Smokey Robinson was honored as with the Music for Life award for his five decades of enduring influence in popular music and for shaping the Motown legacy.</p>

<p><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p>When San Francisco public school teacher David Wish set out to do something about the lack of music education funding at his school, he may never have dreamt of collaborating with world-class celebrities. But what started as a small-scale effort to get instruments in the hands of local underprivileged kids has grown over the past 10 years into the leading nonprofit <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank">Little Kids Rock</a>, with more than 1200 public school teachers providing free music classes to children in their schools.</p>
<p>A program that has supported music education for upwards of 20,000 public school students in 24 cities deserves a serious celebration, and if anyone knows how to get the party started, it&#8217;s Black Eyed Peas member Jaime Gomez, better known to his fans as Taboo.</p>
<p>Taboo will join Little Kids Rock for the <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/rocktheirworld.html" target="_blank">Rock Their World Celebration</a> on September 29 at Facebook Headquarters in Menlo Park, California to mark the organization&#8217;s decade of service, restoring and revitalizing music education for disadvantaged public schools nationwide. Proceeds from the concert will go toward supporting Little Kids Rock programs, helping ensure the organization&#8217;s success continues into the next decade.</p>
<p><span id="more-1053"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LittleKidsRock_anniversary.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1055" title="LittleKidsRock_anniversary" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LittleKidsRock_anniversary-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LittleKidsRock_anniversary-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LittleKidsRock_anniversary.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Taboo began collaborating with Little Kids Rock over a year ago, surprising students by hopping onstage to perform alongside them at their end-of-year concert and inviting them to record an original song at his studio. &#8220;I am all about the youth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am all about the next big thing. Our kids are the next big thing and I will do anything I can do to support them. That&#8217;s why I support Little Kids Rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Taboo isn&#8217;t the only performer working to make music education a priority in public schools. Former Van Halen frontman Sammy &#8220;Red Rocker&#8221; Hagar will perform at the event, as will former Guns N&#8217; Roses drummer Matt Sorum and renowned Grammy-winning guitarist Joe Satriani. These special guests ensure that not only will Little Kids Rock students have the instruments they want to play and the instruction to succeed, but also the role models to inspire them.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, LKR will do it all again on the east coast October 16 at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom in New York City, <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/right2rock.html" target="_blank">celebrating their 10th anniversary</a> with renowned guests including Elvis Costello, Tom Morello and Kris Allen, to name just a few. They&#8217;ll also honor  guitarist Steven Van Zandt (Little Steven) &#8212; Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s legendary axeman &#8212; with their &#8220;Big Man of the Year&#8221; award.</p>
<p>The organization notes that kids who play instruments are 52% more likely to go to college. You can help make sure kids get the music education they need by<a href="https://littlekidsrock.org/donate.html" target="_blank"> donating</a> to Little Kids Rock or participating in their <a href="http://www.biddingforgood.com/auction/AuctionHome.action?vhost=rocktheirworld&amp;aalias=auction" target="_blank">live auction</a>.</p>
