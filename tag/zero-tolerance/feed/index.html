<p><em>By Jay Corliss </em></p>
<p>Since the world learned about thousands of immigrant children being separated from their parents at the US border as part of the new “zero tolerance” immigration policy, many people have been using their platforms to protest the executive order and advocate for the reunification of families who have been separated.</p>
<p>The music community has become particularly passionate about this issue as several musicians and record labels have expressed their outrage at the situation and mobilized their fanbases to take action. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bruce-springsteen-blasts-trumps-inhumane-border-policy/?mbid=social_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Springsteen even diverted from his usual setlist </a>to play “The Ghost of Tom Joad,&#8221; a song about giving a voice to the disenfranchised, and called out the &#8220;inhumane&#8221; policy.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ohboyrecords/status/1009538164573245442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh Boy Records</a> and Third Man Records encouraged their customers to donate to the cause through social media campaigns and by offering in-store incentives.</p>
<p>Also Common, Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES and others have posted links to show fans what actions they can take to support the families impacted by the immigration policy.</p>
<p>“The criminalization and separation of families immigrating to America is inhumane, cruel, and unacceptable,” Common said. “They should be embraced with compassion and love instead of hate and brutality.”</p>
<p>Mayberry encouraged her fans to donate to organizations working to keep families together.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Link to securely donate to a number of organisations working to help children and families being separated and detained by ICE : <a href="https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw">https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the US on June 30 in “Families Belong Together” marches to protest the policy. Lin Manuel-Miranda, creator of the “Hamilton” hit musical, spoke and sang a lullaby he dedicated to parents who were not able to sing to their children.</p>

<p>Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys attended the rally with her young son Egypt and quoted from a letter written by a woman whose child had been taken away from her at the border. &#8220;If it can happen to any child, it can happen to my child, and your child, and all of our children,&#8221; Keys said.</p>
<p>Despite feeling &#8220;hopeless,&#8221; Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff shared a link to the ActBlue fundraiser site where people can contribute to nonprofit groups working to protect kids separated from their families by ICE.</p>
<p>You can learn more about these organizations and <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kidsattheborder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate here</a>.</p>
