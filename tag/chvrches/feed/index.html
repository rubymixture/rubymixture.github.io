<p><em>By Jay Corliss </em></p>
<p>Since the world learned about thousands of immigrant children being separated from their parents at the US border as part of the new “zero tolerance” immigration policy, many people have been using their platforms to protest the executive order and advocate for the reunification of families who have been separated.</p>
<p>The music community has become particularly passionate about this issue as several musicians and record labels have expressed their outrage at the situation and mobilized their fanbases to take action. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bruce-springsteen-blasts-trumps-inhumane-border-policy/?mbid=social_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Springsteen even diverted from his usual setlist </a>to play “The Ghost of Tom Joad,&#8221; a song about giving a voice to the disenfranchised, and called out the &#8220;inhumane&#8221; policy.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ohboyrecords/status/1009538164573245442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh Boy Records</a> and Third Man Records encouraged their customers to donate to the cause through social media campaigns and by offering in-store incentives.</p>
<p>Also Common, Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES and others have posted links to show fans what actions they can take to support the families impacted by the immigration policy.</p>
<p>“The criminalization and separation of families immigrating to America is inhumane, cruel, and unacceptable,” Common said. “They should be embraced with compassion and love instead of hate and brutality.”</p>
<p>Mayberry encouraged her fans to donate to organizations working to keep families together.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Link to securely donate to a number of organisations working to help children and families being separated and detained by ICE : <a href="https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw">https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the US on June 30 in “Families Belong Together” marches to protest the policy. Lin Manuel-Miranda, creator of the “Hamilton” hit musical, spoke and sang a lullaby he dedicated to parents who were not able to sing to their children.</p>

<p>Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys attended the rally with her young son Egypt and quoted from a letter written by a woman whose child had been taken away from her at the border. &#8220;If it can happen to any child, it can happen to my child, and your child, and all of our children,&#8221; Keys said.</p>
<p>Despite feeling &#8220;hopeless,&#8221; Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff shared a link to the ActBlue fundraiser site where people can contribute to nonprofit groups working to protect kids separated from their families by ICE.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em></p>
<p>Drake, Alt-J, The Strokes and several other notable musicians are scheduled to play at the inaugural Landmark Music Festival at Washington, D.C.’s West Potomac Park on September 26-27 to raise funds and awareness for the restoration of the National Mall.</p>
<p>The festival, hosted by the Trust of the National Mall, will include performances from more than 40 artists of both mainstream and underground notoriety, including fun. frontman Nate Ruess, CHVRCHES, Chromeo, and TV on the Radio. The diverse lineup will also feature performances from New Orleans blues band Dr. John &amp; the Nite Trippers, and rapper Wale.</p>
<p>By bringing together a diverse, multicultural group of artists, the festival aims to appeal to a wide range of people in order to yield a large turnout, and educate various demographics about the importance and history of the national park. While serving as a celebration of the National Mall, the festival also aims to “restore [the] voice, values, and history” of Washington D.C.’s famed national park, according to the official Landmark Music Festival website.</p>
<div id="attachment_3426" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-National-Mall.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3426" title="The National Mall" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-National-Mall-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-National-Mall-300x216.jpg 300w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-National-Mall-1024x740.jpg 1024w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-National-Mall.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The National Mall in Washington, DC</p></div>
<p>The Trust for the National Mall is a non-profit organization dedicated to the improvement, preservation, and restoration of the National Mall, which hasn&#8217;t undergone a major renovation in nearly 40 years. The Landmark Festival is the first event in the Trust’s Landmark Campaign for the National Mall, which is designed to ultimately restore and expand the park.</p>
<p>The National Mall is one of the most notable landmarks in Washington D.C., and is home to famous structures such as the Washington Monument, the U.S. Capitol building, and the Lincoln Memorial. It is the most visited national park in the country, hosting more than 29 million people every year. As a result, the park has suffered a great deal of wear-and-tear over the years, and maintenance has been neglected. The park is also suffering from infrastructural issues such as overgrown weeds, weathering structures, and water pollution.</p>
