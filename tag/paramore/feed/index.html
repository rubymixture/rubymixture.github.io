<p><em>By Jay Corliss<br />
</em></p>
<p>Since the tragic school shooting in Parkland, FL last month, students from Parkland School and young people across the country have been advocating for stricter gun control laws and calling for an end to gun violence. Their movement, March For Our Lives, has generated many social media posts, walkouts, and debates about gun laws.</p>
<p>Now it seems that their efforts are inspiring musicians to take a stance on the issue. On March 2, Harry Styles tweeted his support by saying, &#8220;I just signed the @AMarch4OurLives petition, and you should too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The petition precedes the March For Our Lives event on March 24 and outlines the reforms that students will demand from lawmakers as they descend on Washington, DC and various state capitals.</p>
<p>Other musicians who have signed the petition include Hayley Williams from Paramore, St. Vincent, Justin Bieber, and Fifth Harmony&#8217;s Lauren Jauregui.</p>
<p>Recently, Sophie Hawley-Weld from emerging dance-pop duo Sofi Tukker also showed her support for the movement by rocking a March For Our Lives Sticker on her guitar strap during a <em>Conan</em> performance.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrRi1z8_59I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Rock band Incubus are also encouraging fans join the March for Our Lives event, and are offering the chance to win tickets to the upcoming In Bloom Festival in Houston and meet the band <a href="https://www.propeller.la/inbloom">via Propeller</a> by taking action and joining the movement to end gun violence in schools.</p>
<p>“As a band, we are so amazed and in awe of the young humans who have responded to the Parkland School shooting last month in Florida,” Incubus said in a statement. “We support you and we are so grateful for your courage and perseverance in organizing March For Our Lives and rallying the country to help end gun violence.”</p>

<p><em>By Kennedi Johnson</em></p>
<p>It’s music festival season! Coachella, South by Southwest, Bonnaroo, and Karoondinha. What’s that? You haven’t heard of the inaugural <em>Karoondinha</em> festival, yet? No worries—you have now! The festival will make its debut on July 21-23 at Penn’s Cave &amp; Wildlife Park in Centre Hall, Pennsylvania, and benefits several worthwhile non-profits.</p>
<p>The lineup is nothing short of spectacular, with more than 80 performing artists including Chance the Rapper, John Legend, Paramore, Leon Bridges, Young the Giant, Chromeo, Alessia Cara, the Roots, and more. There will also be a kick-off party with more live music and food on July 20. But before we delve into the music any further, let’s talk about the name.</p>
<p>Karoondinha, meaning “the land of shining waters,” was named by the peoples of the Seneca tribe. The land is quite the sight with more than 1,600 acres of breathtaking fields and all that comes with it: sunflowers, water caves, mountain lions, wolves, bison, bears, longhorn cattle, bighorn sheep. In fact, Karoondinha allows for festival goers to not only connect with the music, but also with its beautiful surroundings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/karoondinha1.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-5033" title="karoondinha" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/karoondinha1.png" alt="" width="407" height="211" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/karoondinha1.png 807w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/karoondinha1-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></a>“Unlike many other festivals that take place near urban areas, Karoondinha is truly an immersive experience out in nature,” said the sibling Karoondinha founders Kaleena and Paul Rallis. “We designed Karoondinha to connect people: to the landscape, to each other, and to music.”</p>
<p>The festival is partnering with some terrific non-profits that support nature and wildlife conservation, the fight against hunger and serious illnesses, and music education. The <a href="http://bestwickfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Bestwick Foundation</a> focuses on aiding locals who are struggling with cancer or other grave illnesses. The <a href="http://www.centralpafoodbank.org/" target="_blank">Central Pennsylvania Food Bank</a> is dedicated to fighting America’s problem of hunger by helping those in need. It secures at least 40 million meals for Central Pennsylvania’s hungry citizens each year. The <a href="http://www.wildlifeforeveryone.org/" target="_blank">Wildlife for Everyone Foundation</a> focuses on preserving Pennsylvanian habitats and wildlife, working to conserve its birds and mammals, provide wildlife education and outreach, conduct research, and restore damaged habitats.</p>

<p><em>By Anna DiBlosi</em></p>
<p>Queens of the Stone Age frontman Joshua Homme, alongside bands Paramore and Jimmy Eat World, launched the charity The Sweet Stuff Foundation to support career musicians and recording engineers with medical treatment, income assistance and more in times of need.</p>
<p>Since the launch, additional bands such as Vampire Weekend and the Foo Fighters have offered their support, with the Foo Fighters recently touting the Foundation&#8217;s good work on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/foofighters/posts/10155442487495545?notif_t=notify_me" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>The Sweet Stuff provides necessities such as income assistance, medical treatment, and special treatments not covered by insurance to help career musicians and their families in times of illness or disability, according to the Foundation’s mission statement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sweet-stuff-foundation.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3411" title="sweet-stuff-foundation" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sweet-stuff-foundation-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="192" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sweet-stuff-foundation-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sweet-stuff-foundation-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sweet-stuff-foundation.jpg 462w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" /></a>The Foundation takes a “two pronged approach,” which means providing both assistance for musicians with illness or disability and fostering musical creativity for children through outlets such as music lessons, instruments and musical collaborations.</p>
<p>Currently working to increase program funding and awareness, Homme is planning a benefit event for the end of this year. The event, though still in the planning stages, is slated to feature Homme and others who wish to aid in publicly promoting the cause.</p>
<p>“Getting the word out, getting people involved, that’s our goal right now,” said Cecilia Diaz of The Sweet Stuff Foundation.</p>
<p>The Sweet Stuff Foundation began in 2013 and it&#8217;s now stepping up its efforts to gain notoriety. One of its initial beneficiaries was Austin Pettit, a career musician known for his work with Grinder Switch and the Austin Pettit Band. When he was diagnosed with cancer and pulmonary disease, the Foundation stepped in and helped his family pay their mortgage and keep their home.</p>
