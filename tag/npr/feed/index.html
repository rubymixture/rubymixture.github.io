<p>Chris Thile, a four-time Grammy-winning artist and member of Punch Brothers and Nickel Creek, gave a rare solo performance on July 5 benefitting FLOW (For Love of Water), a nonprofit organization that works to protect the Great Lakes through use of public trust principles and an underpinning of science and technical analysis.</p>
<p>Guests on the grounds of the newly restored Cherry Basket Farm in Omena, MI were greeted with delicious cocktails and snacks before gathering inside a barn for the concert, which consisted of a broad range of Thile’s original tunes as well as impressive Radiohead and Bach covers interpreted on the mandolin.</p>
<p>Thile, who also hosts NPR’s popular radio show <em>Live From Here</em> (formerly known as <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>), spoke passionately about the importance of organizations like FLOW. &#8220;What organizations like FLOW are doing is considered to be among the most important work that humanity is doing, that we&#8217;re doing it is a testament to the ultimate goodness of humanity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Audience members were united in their love of both the Great Lakes and the music, and felt it was a powerful experience to see so many people coming together in the spirit of a good cause – protecting Michigan&#8217;s water – and watching Thile perform silhouetted against the setting sun with his mandolin.</p>

<p><em></em>It’s hard to think of something powerful enough to bring together such a diverse array of supporters as Jack White, Best Coast, Passion Pit, Jens Lekman, Jakob Dylan, Tenacious D and The Roots. But<a href="http://publicradiomusicmonth.org/"> Public Radio Music Month</a> has done just that.</p>
<p>All of these artists and many others recently signed an open letter to public radio, thanking it for playing music that doesn’t sound like everything else on the radio, and for asking intelligent questions. My Morning Jacket, Eddie Vedder, Ozomatli, MGMT and Marketa Irglova also signed their names to bring attention to the importance of public radio.</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking chances. Thank you for playing our music even when – especially when – it doesn’t sound like everything else on the radio dial,” the letter reads. “Thank you for inviting us into your studios and asking us intelligent questions. Thank you for introducing us to some of the most important music in our lives, music that made us who we are.”</p>
<p>What’s more, singer Nellie McKay published a lengthy editorial in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nellie-mckay/public-radio_b_1406791.html ">Huffington Post</a> touting the cultural benefits of public radio and explaining how it changed her life. “Public radio is the last oasis of free and independent music,” she said. “For satellite radio channels, you have to subscribe; commercial stations are as corporate as basic cable. Musicians who don&#8217;t fall neatly into any clear genre would be lost without the local and national support of NPR and public radio stations around the country.”</p>
<p>For years, National Public Radio has provided a much-needed alternative to major corporate radio stations that gives lesser-known artists valuable exposure and showcases groundbreaking music hand-selected by DJs.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p><em></em>SXSW is in full swing, and thousands of people in the music, tech and film industries have descended upon Austin for the annual gathering. While the sheer number of noteworthy events is enough to make your head spin – approximately 3,000 bands from around the world will perform on stages all over the city – here are a few that have made our radar because they combine music and great causes.</p>
<p><strong>Gram Parsons Foundation launch event Wed March 14</strong></p>
<p>To celebrate the relaunch of the <a href="http://www.gramparsonsfoundation.org/">Gram Parsons Foundation</a>, a non-profit that offers addiction and recovery services to artists and musicians and imparts prevention messages to kids, will hold a two-part bash at Hotel San Jose. The day party is free and open to the public (no wristbands or badges required), and features performances by Brendan Benson, Eric Burdon, Blitzen Trapper, Alberta Cross, Great Lake Swimmers, Jenny O and Poor Man (Christian and Casey from Fleet Foxes), and will be streamed live at <a href="http://www.venueone.com/">VenueOne</a>.

<p><strong>Warby Parker&#8217;s Citizens&#8217; Circus March 13-14</strong></p>
<p>This free, all-ages day party at the French Legation Museum combines entertainment from New York’s unique musical circus troupe with socially conscious organizations and companies that will be handing out literature and selling their wares.

<p>It will feature performances by several artists including Big Deal, Father John Misty, La Sera, Dee Dee (Dum Dum Girls), Nikki Lane, Superhumanoids and more, as well as performances by Warby Parker&#8217;s Citizens&#8217; Circus.

<p><strong>KGSR brunches at the W Hotel benefitting Make-A-Wish Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Austin radio station KGSR has the early-morning market cornered with brunches at the W Hotel March 14-17. For a $5 donation to the <a href="http://www.wish.org/">Make-A-Wish Foundation</a>, which grants wishes to children with life-threatening diseases, you get a breakfast snack and four hours of exclusive performances from artists including Tom Morello, Blitzen Trapper, Delta Spirit, Ben Kweller, M.

<p><strong>KCRW showcases</strong></p>
<p>Los Angeles’ flagship NPR station KCRW will hold two official showcases with some of the great talent it has been touting over the airwaves. The non-profit, member funded station will feature artists including Alabama Shakes, Temper Trap, Willy Mason Band of Skulls, Honey Honey and Blood Orangeat its showcases March 14 and March 16. Go <a href="http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2012/02/kcrw-at-sxsw-2012/">here</a> for more information and set times.</p>
<p><strong>Perez Hilton’s “One Night In Austin” SXSW party benefitting VH1 Save The Music Foundation</strong></p>
<p>Perez Hilton will donate all the proceeds from his highly anticipated SXSW bash “One Night In Austin” on March 17 to the VH1 Save The Music Foundation to bolster music education in public schools.</p>
<p>This is the first time Hilton is selling tickets to the annual event, which will be held at the Austin Music Hall on Saturday, from 6 p.m.-2 a.m. Hilton is revealing the lineup day-by-day on <a href="http://perezhilton.com/">his website</a> leading up to the night. So far, The Ting Tings, Ed Sheeran, Cher Lloyd and Dev have been confirmed as performers.</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Fire post-SXSW lecture on Haiti and service</strong></p>
<p>Arcade Fire have announced that they will give a lecture titled “Hope, Haiti and Service” at the University of Texas at Austin on March 19.  According the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/universityunions/node/746">University’s website</a>, Win Butler, Regine Chassagne, Will Butler, and Marika Anthony-Shaw of the Montreal-based, Grammy Award-winning band will discuss the current socio-economic crisis in Haiti, and their own volunteer efforts in the region.</p>
<p>The band will also tout the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.pih.org/">Partners in Health</a>, whose efforts to rebuild Haiti they’ve supported for years. It has also fueled serious speculation that Arcade Fire will make an appearance at SXSW.</p>
<p><strong>And there&#8217;s more&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>We’re also looking forward to catching <a href="http://www.theparlotones.net/">The Parlotones</a>, who just climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro to raise awareness of violence against women and girls in Africa, and the <a href="http://deltaspirit.net/">Delta Spirit</a>, who will be taking Invisible Children out on tour with them in support of its Kony 2012 campaign, at several official SXSW showcases and parties. Also, Fiona Apple, who performed at “Love and Haiti, Too: A Music Benefit” and has offered assistance to <a href="http://826la.org/index.php?page=home">826LA</a>, a non-profit that supports young students with their creative writing and offers tutoring for English learners, will debut songs from her first new album since 2005’s “Extraordinary Machine.” She&#8217;ll be at the <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> showcase at Stubb’s on March 14 and will surely be popping up around town. Also, Columbian superstar Juanes will discuss his  charitable work for his own <a href="http://www.fundacionmisangre.org/">Mi Sangre Foundation</a> and as a co-founder of the <a href="http://pazsinfronteras.org/">&#8220;Paz sin Fronteras&#8221; (Peace Without Borders)</a> organization, which uses music to unite populaces regardless of political or geographic divides and advocate that all people are entitled to the basic human right of peace. He&#8217;ll participate in a Q &amp; A at the Austin Convention Center, room 18ABC at 12:30 p.m. on Fri, March 16 before he performs that evening.</p>
