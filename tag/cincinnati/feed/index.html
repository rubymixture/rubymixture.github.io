<p><em>By Jay Corliss</em></p>
<p>Jack White was recently presented with the key to Cincinnati by the city’s Mayor John Cranley in front of the historic King Records building. This event was held to honor the renowned rocker’s advocacy for music preservation and most importantly his support of King Records.</p>
<p>Opened in 1943, King Records quickly became a creative workspace and mecca for many notable musicians. James Brown recorded several hits at King, and it was there that he and Bootsy Collins began their musical collaboration. Despite its rich history, the building was set to be demolished, and it was only through extensive community efforts to secure its landmark status, vocal support from renowned musicians including Jack White and Bootsy Collins, and a recent deal and acquisition by the city of Cincinnati, that it is being preserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack White has been an unfailing supporter of King Records,&#8221; said Mayor Cranley. &#8220;Jack has actually covered Little Willie John&#8217;s song, ‘I&#8217;m Shakin&#8217;,’ which on the original recording our own Philip Paul played the drums, and he recently wore a King Records shirt in a cover story for Q Magazine.&#8221;</p>

The committee includes leaders from  the Cincinnati USA Music Heritage Foundation, King Studios and the Bootsy Collins Foundation.</p>
