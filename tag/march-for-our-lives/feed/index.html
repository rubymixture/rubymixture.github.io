<p><em>By Jay Corliss<br />
</em></p>
<p>Since the tragic school shooting in Parkland, FL last month, students from Parkland School and young people across the country have been advocating for stricter gun control laws and calling for an end to gun violence. Their movement, March For Our Lives, has generated many social media posts, walkouts, and debates about gun laws.</p>
<p>Now it seems that their efforts are inspiring musicians to take a stance on the issue. On March 2, Harry Styles tweeted his support by saying, &#8220;I just signed the @AMarch4OurLives petition, and you should too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The petition precedes the March For Our Lives event on March 24 and outlines the reforms that students will demand from lawmakers as they descend on Washington, DC and various state capitals.</p>
<p>Other musicians who have signed the petition include Hayley Williams from Paramore, St. Vincent, Justin Bieber, and Fifth Harmony&#8217;s Lauren Jauregui.</p>
<p>Recently, Sophie Hawley-Weld from emerging dance-pop duo Sofi Tukker also showed her support for the movement by rocking a March For Our Lives Sticker on her guitar strap during a <em>Conan</em> performance.</p>

<p>Rock band Incubus are also encouraging fans join the March for Our Lives event, and are offering the chance to win tickets to the upcoming In Bloom Festival in Houston and meet the band <a href="https://www.propeller.la/inbloom">via Propeller</a> by taking action and joining the movement to end gun violence in schools.</p>
<p>“As a band, we are so amazed and in awe of the young humans who have responded to the Parkland School shooting last month in Florida,” Incubus said in a statement. “We support you and we are so grateful for your courage and perseverance in organizing March For Our Lives and rallying the country to help end gun violence.”</p>
