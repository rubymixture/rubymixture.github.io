<p><em>By Jay Corliss</em></p>
<p>Jack White was recently presented with the key to Cincinnati by the city’s Mayor John Cranley in front of the historic King Records building. This event was held to honor the renowned rocker’s advocacy for music preservation and most importantly his support of King Records.</p>
<p>Opened in 1943, King Records quickly became a creative workspace and mecca for many notable musicians. James Brown recorded several hits at King, and it was there that he and Bootsy Collins began their musical collaboration. Despite its rich history, the building was set to be demolished, and it was only through extensive community efforts to secure its landmark status, vocal support from renowned musicians including Jack White and Bootsy Collins, and a recent deal and acquisition by the city of Cincinnati, that it is being preserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack White has been an unfailing supporter of King Records,&#8221; said Mayor Cranley. &#8220;Jack has actually covered Little Willie John&#8217;s song, ‘I&#8217;m Shakin&#8217;,’ which on the original recording our own Philip Paul played the drums, and he recently wore a King Records shirt in a cover story for Q Magazine.&#8221;</p>

The committee includes leaders from  the Cincinnati USA Music Heritage Foundation, King Studios and the Bootsy Collins Foundation.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant </em></p>
<p>Musicians across the U.S. are rallying to donate much-needed clean water and funds to help the citizens of Flint, Michigan during the city’s deadly water crisis, which has already contaminated thousands of residents with extremely high levels of lead.</p>
<p>The water crisis finally received national media coverage earlier this month after President Obama declared a federal state of emergency, following a Virginia Tech study of the city’s water quality, and a string of class-action lawsuits.</p>
<p>Pop singer Cher, with the help of the Icelandic Glacial bottled water company, is donating 181,440 bottles of water to the residents of Flint. Cher has been outspoken about the crisis on social media, criticizing Michigan’s elected officials for their negligence in handling the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;This a tragedy of staggering proportion and shocking that it&#8217;s happening in the middle of our country…I cannot wait for the water to get there to help these people who have been poisoned because the water they&#8217;ve been getting out of their taps has been polluted for so long and remains that way without the state or the federal government stepping in with any substantial plan to resolve this problem,” said Cher in a statement.</p>
<div id="attachment_4076" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pearl-Jam.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4076" title="Pearl Jam" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pearl-Jam-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pearl-Jam-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pearl-Jam.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pearl Jam</p></div>
<p>The water will be distributed by the <a href="https://www.fbem.org/" target="_blank">Food Bank of Eastern Michigan</a> to other foodbanks, community centers and low-income housing areas throughout Flint – a city in which 40 percent of  the population lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p>Jack White’s record label, Third Man Records, is also lending a helping hand. It organized a water drive in Flint, and launched a campaign to raise money for relief efforts. The label is encouraging people to donate to its <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/thirdmanrecords" target="_blank">Crowdrise fundraiser</a> and is offering a grand prize to one lucky donor. The grand prize winner will become a Platinum Vault Subscriber for the next 5 years and receive 20 free packages with all types of merchandise and memorabilia from the label.</p>
<p>All of the donations will go to the United Way of <a href="http://www.unitedwaygenesee.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5" target="_blank">Genesee County Flint Water Fund</a>. The money will be used to purchase water filters, bottled water and emergency services, and the remaining donations will go towards the Flint Child Health and Development Fund—an initiative to help children poisoned by the contaminated drinking water.</p>
<p>Legendary grunge band <a href="http://www.pearljam.com/news/0/1/22867/join_pearl_jam_help_flint" target="_blank">Pearl Jam</a> donated $125,000 to the United Way of Genesee County, and inspired several of their friends and partners such as Brandi Carlile’s Looking Out Foundation, Glasper Progress Foundation, Live Nation, Republic Records, Ticketmaster and Universal Music Publishing Group to donate an additional $175,000.</p>
<p>Pearl Jam is urging fans to donate to the cause via <a href="http://crowdrise.com/fundraise-and-volunteer/donate-desktop/project/pearljam/pearljam1/0" target="_blank">Crowdrise</a> and have already raised $20,000.</p>
<p>Several artists in the hip-hop community have also stepped up to help Flint survive its deadly water crisis. Big Sean, a rapper from nearby Detroit, donated $10,000 with a <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/bigsean" target="_blank">fundraiser on Crowdrise</a> called #HealFlintKids through his <a href="http://seanandersonfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Sean Anderson Foundation</a> to assist the Flint Child Health &amp; Development Fund.</p>
<p>“I am devastated by the water crisis that has put the entire city of Flint in a state of emergency,” said Sean in a statement to the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4077" style="width: 193px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-Sean.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4077" title="Big Sean" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-Sean.jpeg" alt="" width="183" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Big Sean</p></div>
<p>Big Sean’s campaign is also packed with incentives, and people who donate $10 or more will get a chance to win two VIP tickets to see the Detroit rapper in concert, complete with a meet-and-greet and photo opportunities.</p>
<p>Compton rapper The Game donated $500,000 to Flint, and promised that water bottle company Avita Water will donate an additional $500,000. The $1 million total donation will be facilitated by The Game’s charity <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therobinhoodproject/" target="_blank">The Robin Hood Project</a>, which assists poverty-stricken families and individuals.</p>
<p>Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill also got in on the action and donated 600,000 bottles of water to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan and to the Flint Child Health &amp; Development Fund.</p>
<p>Flint’s drinking water became contaminated in 2014, after the state switched the city’s water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which was already notorious for being dirty, according to a report by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/health/toxic-tap-water-flint-michigan/" target="_blank">CNN</a>. A Virginia Tech study revealed that Flint River is 19 times more corrosive than Lake Huron, which caused old lead pipes to leak into the water supply.</p>

<p><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p>Some events have tickets so sought-after, snagging them requires the perfect storm of a lightning-fast internet connection, a fluency in captcha, and a lot of luck.</p>
<p>Tickets for Virgin Mobile FreeFest disappeared a record two minutes after going on sale in August, but those who failed to hit &#8220;refresh&#8221; at exactly the right moment can still catch Jack White, Skrillex, M83, ZZ Top and more at the October 6 event by giving a few hours back to their community.</p>
<p>Now through September 28, anyone can sign up for a free ticket by volunteering at an approved homeless shelter in Maryland, Virginia, or Washington through Virgin Mobile&#8217;s <a href="http://www.virginmobilefreeip.com/" target="_blank">FREE I.P. program</a>. Participants will help with a range of activities, including assembling bag lunches and snack baskets, painting and gardening to brighten up youth homeless shelters, and donating school supplies or other needed items.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s concert will also feature artists including Santigold, Alabama Shakes, Ben Folds Five, Porter Robinson and Nas.</p>
<p><span id="more-953"></span>Since the FREE I.P. program&#8217;s inception, Virgin Mobile volunteers and fans have given 75,000 volunteer hours and raised more than half a million dollars for The RE*Generation, Virgin Mobile&#8217;s initiative to address youth homelessness. Just last year, supporters raised enough money to enable the opening of The RE*Generation House, a homeless youth shelter in Washington, DC developed by <a href="http://sashabruce.org/" target="_blank">Sasha Bruce Youthwork</a>. Proceeds from this year&#8217;s FreeFest will go toward running programs for social entrepreneurship and urban agriculture at The RE*Gen House and other Sasha Bruce sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spirit of FreeFest has always been about giving back, both as a business and to music fans,” said Felicia Hill, manager of brand engagement and cause marketing at Virgin Mobile USA. &#8220;Homeless youth is still an overlooked issue that continues to need our support. We’ve been dedicated to transforming the lives of these young people and getting more people to take action to help the cause since we launched The RE*Generation [initiative].&#8221;</p>
<p>Now in its fourth year, Virgin Mobile&#8217;s Freefest has provided the Washington, DC area with a completely free music festival at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. All they ask in return is that attendees &#8220;take care of the karma&#8221; and donate a minimum of $10 to <a href="https://virginmobilefestival.com/donate/" target="_blank">The RE*Generation</a> to empower a generation to help its own.</p>

<p><em>By Michael Tedder</em></p>
<p>Alarm frontman Mike Peters has never been one to think small. This is, after all, a musician whose first major hit was called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLK3k_0GHrg" target="_blank">“68 Guns.”</a>  The official legend of the cancer research foundation Love Hope Strength, which Peters co-founded, goes that when Peters was receiving cancer treatment in Wales, he would always look out of his hospital window and see a mountaintop. He told his doctors that when he had recovered, he would perform on that mountaintop to raise money for cancer research.</p>
<p>Peters later founded Love Hope Strength in 2007 with Texas-based live music promoter James Chippendale. Since then, the foundation has organized a number of ambitious events, including treks to Machu Picchu, Kilimanjaro and Mount Fuji that featured musicians like G. Love and Donavan Frankenreiter hiking up some of the world’s tallest mountains alongside cancer survivors and supporters, and then performing for the volunteers. “Some people love music, and some people love adventure and a challenge, and we’ve all these passions and put them all in to one crazy foundation,” Shannon Foley Henn, Executive Director of Love Hope Strength, tells Music for Good.</p>
<p>Love Hope Strength has helped raise money to fund a mobile cancer unit in Peru and purchased the first mammogram and radiation machines for Nepal. The foundation tends to think big, but its directors realize that not everyone can take a few weeks off to travel across the world. Which is why their upcoming event Colorado Rocks will take place at the more accessible location of Vail Mountain on the weekend of July 14. G. Love, Brett Dennen, Cy Curnin of The Fixx and Miles Zuniga of Fastball and young musicians from the School of Rock will hike alongside fans and then perform an acoustic show. There’s still time to<a href="http://lovehopestrength.org/colorado/welcome-colorado-rocks/" target="_blank"> register to participate</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-711"></span><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LHS-logo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-716" title="LHS logo" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LHS-logo-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LHS-logo-203x300.jpg 203w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LHS-logo-695x1024.jpg 695w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LHS-logo.jpg 1223w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></a></p>
<p>“Everybody is on the same level, if you’re a rock star or a cancer survivor or a supporter, you still have to get up that mountain,” says Foley Henn. “We all do it together as a team, it really puts everyone on the same playing field. Rather than putting a musician on a stage talking to everybody while everybody watches, this is an opportunity to be arm in arm and side by side with these musicians.”</p>
<p>There will also be an 18-day <a href="http://lovehopestrength.org/everest/welcome/ ">Everest Rocks II</a> event in Nepal starting on November 25. But if you can’t make it to the mountain this year, Love Hope Strength will bring the mountain to you, so to speak. In addition to the Colorado and Nepal events, the foundation is organizing the Get On The List campaign, which will allow concertgoers at this summer’s Lollapalooza to register with the national bone marrow database <a href="http://www.dkmsamericas.org/" target="_blank">DKMS</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://lovehopestrength.org/events/current-events/#get" target="_blank">Get On The List</a> campaign will also be present at upcoming Jack White, Norah Jones, B-52s and Foster The People tour stops, amongst others.</p>
<p>“We were doing all these crazy concerts and not every musician could take time off from their schedule to do these insane trips,” explains Foley Henn. “We started getting these requests from musicians to reach out to their fans at their concerts and raise money and awareness..and (they) were in front of these crowds of thousands, and we were getting an opportunity to tell them about building a cancer center in Africa and in Nepal. We kept hearing the same thing, which was that everybody was touched by cancer, their sister or their mother or they personally had cancer, and they wanted to know what we were doing to help them, which was a valid question. So this is a way to get fans involved without asking them for money – we’re just asking them for saliva.  At Bonnaroo, we found 15 matches.”</p>
<p>The testing process is very simple. Fans swab their cheeks while at the show and put the swab in a sealed envelope, and their information is then entered into a database until they reach age 60. “If they’re a match, they get a phone call,” says Foley Henn. “Usually, it’s as simple as giving blood. You go down to your local hospital, you get an injection for four days in a row. It pushes the blood marrow in to the bloodstream, and on the fifth day you give blood for a few hours. Folks are usually back at work that same day – nothing but a few needles and they’ve saved a life.”</p>

<p><em></em>It’s hard to think of something powerful enough to bring together such a diverse array of supporters as Jack White, Best Coast, Passion Pit, Jens Lekman, Jakob Dylan, Tenacious D and The Roots. But<a href="http://publicradiomusicmonth.org/"> Public Radio Music Month</a> has done just that.</p>
<p>All of these artists and many others recently signed an open letter to public radio, thanking it for playing music that doesn’t sound like everything else on the radio, and for asking intelligent questions. My Morning Jacket, Eddie Vedder, Ozomatli, MGMT and Marketa Irglova also signed their names to bring attention to the importance of public radio.</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking chances. Thank you for playing our music even when – especially when – it doesn’t sound like everything else on the radio dial,” the letter reads. “Thank you for inviting us into your studios and asking us intelligent questions. Thank you for introducing us to some of the most important music in our lives, music that made us who we are.”</p>
<p>What’s more, singer Nellie McKay published a lengthy editorial in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nellie-mckay/public-radio_b_1406791.html ">Huffington Post</a> touting the cultural benefits of public radio and explaining how it changed her life. “Public radio is the last oasis of free and independent music,” she said. “For satellite radio channels, you have to subscribe; commercial stations are as corporate as basic cable. Musicians who don&#8217;t fall neatly into any clear genre would be lost without the local and national support of NPR and public radio stations around the country.”</p>
<p>For years, National Public Radio has provided a much-needed alternative to major corporate radio stations that gives lesser-known artists valuable exposure and showcases groundbreaking music hand-selected by DJs.</p>
