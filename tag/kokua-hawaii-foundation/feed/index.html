<p><em>by Rachel Komich</em></p>
<p>Jack Johnson will headline the Kōkua for Kaua’i benefit concert on May 12 to help restore the community of Kaua’i after unprecedented rains caused widespread devastation on the Hawaiian island, leaving thousands of residents in need of support to rebuild their homes, businesses and farms.</p>
<p>The concert, which will also feature Donavon Frankenreiter, Paula Fuga, and Makana, will take place at the Poipu Beach Athletic Club in Kauai and directly benefit the displaced residents.</p>
<p>All of the proceeds will go to the Kauai Relief &amp; Recovery Fund at Hawai’i Community Foundation (HFC), a fund created to provide immediate relief such as shelter, healthcare, and food and water. HFC is the leading philanthropic institution in Hawaii and distributed more than $59 million in grants and contracts in 2017 alone.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting thousands of locals, the benefit show will be entirely plastic free. There will be no single-use plastic items available for purchase. Instead, beverages will be sold in cans, and all silverware will be compostable. Concert-goers are encouraged to bring their own reusable bottles to refill at water stations, part of the Zero Waste Kauai initiative.</p>

<p>Johnson, who grew up in Hawaii and is an avid supporter of several environmental causes, founded the Kokua Hawaii Foundation with his wife Kim. The foundation supports environmental education for children in Hawaiian schools and teaches them about good health &amp; nutrition in addition to environmental stewardship. Through his tours, albums and personal donations, he has given more than $30 million to charity since 2001.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant </em></p>
<p>Singer-songwriter and environmental activist Jack Johnson is back on the road for the first time since 2014 for a North American summer tour, which kicks off June 17 in Chicago and makes its way to the West Coast with a stop at the Hollywood Bowl on July 16.</p>
<p>Johnson’s 2017 tour will support more than140 non-profits through his environmental campaign and social action network, All At Once. One of the primary aims of Johnson’s tour is to provide greener alternatives during his shows in order to lessen their impacts on the environment and the cities in which he’s performing.</p>
<p>Since 2007, all of Johnson’s shows have offered concert-goers free water courtesy of water refill stations in order to curb the use of disposable plastic.</p>
<p>In 2014, the “Banana Pancakes” singer launched the Reusable Pint Program, an initiative designed to provide fans with alternatives to plastic cups and bottles. Instead, fans can purchase stainless steel cups, and as an added bonus, those who buy the cups receive discounts on beverage refills.</p>
<p>In addition, Johnson is implementing many other greening efforts in his 2017 summer tour. Sustainable bio-diesel tour vehicles, recycling, composting, and eco-friendly merchandise are just some of the programs that will help lessen the tour’s impact on the environment. The tour will also source local, organic food as part of a &#8220;farm to stage&#8221; program, offer alternative transportation incentives and bike valets.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Johnson has made environmental activism a top priority and uses his platform as a popular artist to make a difference. “Growing up [in Hawaii] I had a profound love for the natural world and the environment and the ocean,” <a href="http://musicforgood.tv/2016/03/jack-johnson-interview-the-musician-environmentalist-illustrates-how-easy-it-is-to-be-green/" target="_blank">Johnson told Music for Good</a> last year.</p>
<p>“As I got older, I found myself in this position [as a musician] where I suddenly had the ability to gather lots of people at once.” Since then, Johnson has creatively leveraged his public platform to inform people about how they can implement positive change in their communities, and has “walked the walk,” donating 100 percent of the profits from his tours between 2008-2013 to environmental nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>He also founded two nonprofits—<a href="http://www.johnsonohana.org/" target="_blank">Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation</a>, which supports charitable organizations that focus on the environment, art and music education, and <a href="https://kokuahawaiifoundation.org/" target="_blank">Kokua Hawaii Foundation</a>, which funds environmental education for schools in Hawaii and teaches children about health and nutrition.</p>

<p><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p><em></em>For many artists, touring means a chance to see different cities and meet fans from all walks of life. For Jack Johnson, it brings an opportunity to effect change on a local level while mobilizing communities to support local farms.</p>
<p>Although the chart-topping singer/songwriter and longtime environmental activist runs his own <a href="http://kokuahawaiifoundation.org/">Kokua Hawaii Foundation</a>, Johnson’s <em>From Here To Now To You</em> tour will support the work of other local and national nonprofit organizations that focus on sustainable agriculture, food access, farm-to-school projects, and other food policy issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;While on tour we are lucky to be able to enjoy food from every region that we visit,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Supporting local farmers at each stop is important to us. Along the way we have met many amazing non-profit groups that promote local, organic, and sustainable food in their communities and schools. Food Day is a great opportunity to introduce people to these groups who are doing important work and celebrate our connection to food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout Johnson&#8217;s fall tour dates across Europe and North America, fans will be able to connect with non-profits in their communities and share their commitment to local food on <a href="http://www.allatonce.org">AllAtOnce.org</a>. These <a href="http://www.foodday.org/partner_organizations">partner organizations</a> include <a href="http://www.farmaid.org/">Farm Aid</a>, <a href="http://www.change.org">Change.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/">Slow Food USA</a> and a suite of local organizations and chef groups.</p>
<p>The tour culminates just before the third annual <a href="http://www.foodday.org/">Food Day</a> on October 24. Food Day supports thousands of events in all 50 states promote healthy, affordable, and sustainably produced food. This year, organizers will focus on encouraging children to cook and asking adults who can cook to pass on their skills. While Food Day won’t accept funding from government or industry, they do encourage forward-thinking companies to host events.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Johnson&#8217;s sixth studio album, <em>From Here To Now To You</em>, hit Number 1 on the Billboard charts.</p>

<p><em></em>Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson has released a 13-song compilation of live performance highlights from Hawaii’s Kokua Festival featuring tracks by Eddie Vedder, Willie Nelson, Ziggy Marley, Jackson Browne and more, titled “Jack Johnson and Friends: Best of Kokua Festival.” The compilation marks the celebration of Earth Day, and benefits the <a href="http://kokuahawaiifoundation.org/ ">Kokua Hawaii Foundation</a>, which promotes conservation education in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Johnson, a native of Hawaii, has been involved in conservation and greening efforts for several years. He pointed out that the impressive array of musicians who participate in the festival all support environmental efforts in their own ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the musicians who&#8217;ve played at the Kokua Festival have a connection to the cause and the work we are doing with the foundation,&#8221; Johnson told CNN. &#8220;The musicians themselves were a big inspiration for the foundation from the start &#8212; like how Willie Nelson runs his tour buses and trucks on biodiesel and how Eddie Vedder has been active in several environmental causes.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the proceeds from sales of the album will go to the Kokua Hawaii Foundation, which Johnson says will allow it to “continue inspiring Hawaii&#8217;s next generation of environmental stewards.” Click <a href="http://kokuafestival.com/best/">here</a> for more information.</p>
