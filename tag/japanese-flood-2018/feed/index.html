<p><em>By Jay Corliss</em></p>
<p>After learning about the worst flood to hit Japan since 1982, Yoshiki of the popular Japanese band X Japan made a donation of 10 million yen (approximately $88,455) to the Japanese Red Cross Society through his own 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization Yoshiki Foundation America.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just saw the news in the U.S., and I pray for those who passed away. I truly hope the damage caused by heavy rain will not spread any more,&#8221; the international superstar shared on social media.</p>
<p>The flood and subsequent landslides and heatwave in southwestern Japan have caused significant devastation, creating a death toll of more than 200, destroying several homes, and leaving thousands without electricity or water.</p>
<p>Yoshiki is no stranger to donating to causes or those in need. In the past, he&#8217;s supported campaigns to help relief and restoration efforts following hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico and earthquakes in Kumamoto and Tohoku, Japan. Most of his donations are made through his charitable organization Yoshiki Foundation America, which he originally established to support children who have lost family members to suicide.</p>
<p>Yoshiki tragically lost his father to suicide when he was a child. &#8220;I will continue to engage in charity activities as long as I am working as an artist,” he said.</p>
