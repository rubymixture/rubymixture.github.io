<p><em>By Jay Corliss </em></p>
<p>Since the world learned about thousands of immigrant children being separated from their parents at the US border as part of the new “zero tolerance” immigration policy, many people have been using their platforms to protest the executive order and advocate for the reunification of families who have been separated.</p>
<p>The music community has become particularly passionate about this issue as several musicians and record labels have expressed their outrage at the situation and mobilized their fanbases to take action. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bruce-springsteen-blasts-trumps-inhumane-border-policy/?mbid=social_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Springsteen even diverted from his usual setlist </a>to play “The Ghost of Tom Joad,&#8221; a song about giving a voice to the disenfranchised, and called out the &#8220;inhumane&#8221; policy.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ohboyrecords/status/1009538164573245442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh Boy Records</a> and Third Man Records encouraged their customers to donate to the cause through social media campaigns and by offering in-store incentives.</p>
<p>Also Common, Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES and others have posted links to show fans what actions they can take to support the families impacted by the immigration policy.</p>
<p>“The criminalization and separation of families immigrating to America is inhumane, cruel, and unacceptable,” Common said. “They should be embraced with compassion and love instead of hate and brutality.”</p>
<p>Mayberry encouraged her fans to donate to organizations working to keep families together.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Link to securely donate to a number of organisations working to help children and families being separated and detained by ICE : <a href="https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw">https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the US on June 30 in “Families Belong Together” marches to protest the policy. Lin Manuel-Miranda, creator of the “Hamilton” hit musical, spoke and sang a lullaby he dedicated to parents who were not able to sing to their children.</p>

<p>Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys attended the rally with her young son Egypt and quoted from a letter written by a woman whose child had been taken away from her at the border. &#8220;If it can happen to any child, it can happen to my child, and your child, and all of our children,&#8221; Keys said.</p>
<p>Despite feeling &#8220;hopeless,&#8221; Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff shared a link to the ActBlue fundraiser site where people can contribute to nonprofit groups working to protect kids separated from their families by ICE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AliciaKeys23Ways.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4551" title="AliciaKeys23Ways" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AliciaKeys23Ways.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="276" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AliciaKeys23Ways.jpg 800w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AliciaKeys23Ways-300x246.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></a>By James Pleasant</em></p>
<p><em></em>Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys assembled dozens of celebrities to stand in solidarity with the victims of institutional racism.</p>
<p>In the video <em>23 Ways to Be Killed If You’re Black in America</em>, part of Keys’ “We Are Here” movement, musicians, actors, and comedians including Beyoncé, Pharrell, Queen Latifah, Kevin Hart, Chris Rock, Lenny Kravitz, and Bono cite 23 different incidents in which black lives were ended for frivolous reasons—namely at the hands of law enforcement.</p>
<p>The video was released a week after the senseless murders of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile by police officers in Louisiana and Minnesota, respectively. Sterling was shot point-blank by officers after he was detained for selling CDs outside of a grocery store, and Castile was shot dead in his car after reaching in his pocket for his ID after the officer’s instructions. Both deaths were referenced in the video.</p>
<p>The various reasons for many senseless deaths included “wearing a hoodie” (in reference to Trayvon Martin); “selling cigarettes outside of a corner store” (Eric Garner); “making eye contact” (Freddie Gray), and “calling for help after an accident” (Renisha McBride).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_VaNhI4CLo" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>“The time for change is now,” says Keys in the video clip. “We demand radical transformation to heal the long history of systemic racism so that all Americans have the equal right to live and pursue happiness.”</p>
<p>The video is also tied to We Are Here’s “Moonshoot” petition urging President Obama and Congress to allocate $150 billion for poor communities in the United States, in order to end the institutional racism that has harmed people of color for centuries. The petition calls for these funds to help provide access to healthcare, equal education, housing, job training, nutrition, and reform of the Criminal Justice System over the next 10 years.</p>

<p><em>By Sarah Weiss</em></p>
<p>World-renowned DJ Tiesto, along with Above and Beyond, Krewella, and Alvin Risk will headline the first-ever Thank You Festival, set to take place at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland on June 26. The D.C. area fest is presented by the <a href="http://www.globalcitizen.org/thankyou" target="_blank">Global Citizen</a> movement in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.childhood.org" target="_blank">World Childhood Foundation</a> in an effort to raise awareness about issues facing children worldwide and further efforts to protect them from disease, violence and abuse.</p>
<p>DJ Tiesto stated, “Through my work with the World Childhood Foundation, I’ve learned about the millions of kids who are battling abuse and even dying from diseases that have known cures. I hope all my fans will join me in working with these amazing organizations to help these children all around the world live and become healthy and strong so they can enjoy their childhoods.”</p>
<p>The Global Poverty Project introduced the Global Citizen Festival in 2012, which has featured renowned musical performers including Stevie Wonder, John Mayer, Foo Fighters, Kings of Leon, Alicia Keys and Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse at the annual festival held at New York’s Central Park.</p>
<p>&#8220;To become a global citizen, we must extend our compassion beyond our borders,&#8221; says Hugh Evans, CEO of the Global Poverty Project. &#8220;The United States has played a pivotal role in leading child survival and protection efforts worldwide and this event celebrates that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evans adds that the festival is also a chance to educate the younger generation and motivate our leaders to act. &#8220;The bottom line is increased investment in child survival initiatives could ensure that no child dies for the lack of a 30-cent vaccine,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>People can enter to win passes to the Thank You Festival by taking actions to end childhood poverty detailed <a href="http://www.globalcitizen.org/thankyou" target="_blank">here</a>. Tickets can also be purchased <a href="http://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/545417?wrKey=A98DBB879200871885EF1C3DA2D353A3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p>Activism doesn’t always pay the bills, so here’s some good news for global changemakers: You can see Stevie Wonder, Kings of Leon, Alicia Keys and John Mayer for free in exchange for taking action around pressing international issues.</p>
<p>For the second time, <a href="http://www.globalpovertyproject.com/">The Global Poverty Project</a> will host the <a href="http://www.globalfestival.com">Global Citizen Festival</a>, a free ticketed concert on the Great Lawn of New York&#8217;s Central Park. Between now and the September 28 show, fans can earn tickets at <a href="http://www.globalfestival.com" target="_blank">Global Festival.com</a> by taking online actions like watching videos, signing petitions, and sending emails to world leaders.</p>
<p>All the actions center on the festival&#8217;s four themes: education, women&#8217;s equality, global health, and global partnerships. As with last year&#8217;s event, the date corresponds to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where The Global Poverty Project aims to put pressure on participating world leaders to accelerate progress on these issues and help end extreme poverty by 2030.</p>
<p>“Since 1990, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has been halved. We are working to see the end of extreme poverty in our lifetime,” said Hugh Evans, CEO of The <a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Global-Citizen-Festival.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2046" title="Global Citizen Festival" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Global-Citizen-Festival-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Global-Citizen-Festival-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Global-Citizen-Festival.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Global Poverty Project. “We must continue to push our leaders to step up and commit to action in the areas we know are fundamental to ending extreme poverty. This is not just a concert – we are building a movement of yearlong action by thousands of citizens. World leaders respond when citizens call for change. The Global Citizen Festival is that call.”</p>
<p>One of the first actions asks fans to sign <a href="http://www.aworldatschool.org/">A World At School Initiative</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.globalcitizen.org/Content/Content.aspx?id=bbb0b5f7-ec17-47a1-8d2d-76a4b32be284">Stand With Malala Petition</a>, which demands emergency action to help the 57 million children without access to primary education. Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, who earlier this year became the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize nominee, addressed the UN on this topic last week.</p>
<p>Other actions include watching a video and taking a quiz on preventable and curable diseases, designing a condom wrapper that empowers women, sharing stories of entrepreneurs in South Africa, and more. The Global Poverty Project is pushing for one million actions by September.<span id="more-2042"></span></p>
<p>The artists themselves care deeply about the issues at hand. “The number of people around the world living in extreme poverty is staggering,” said Alicia Keys. “They are humanity’s most vulnerable, and as global citizens, we must work to be their voice so that they can live with the same human rights we are privileged to have.”</p>
<p>The Festival has also partnered with <a href="http://www.cottononfoundation.org/">Cotton On Foundation</a>, which <a href="http://shop.cottonon.com/cottonon-foundation/">sells products in a thousand retail stores to</a> fund projects involving health, education, sustainability and infrastructure. Other partners include leading non-profit groups such as the Global Partnership for Education, A World at School Initiative, Women Deliver, World Food Program USA, U.S. Fund for UNICEF, Make Roads Safe, CARE, charity: water, and Malaria No More.</p>
<p>Will you be one of the 54,000 fans to attend The Global Citizen Festival on September 28? <a href="http://www.globalfestival.com">Sign up today to begin taking action.</a></p>
<p>Michael Trainer, Global Poverty Project&#8217;s U.S. Country Director, shared his top 5 bands of the moment with us! Check them out <a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/good-music/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you hadn’t heard, some of the biggest names in music will come together next week for “12-12-12”, the massive Hurricane Sandy benefit concert on December 12 at New York’s Madison Square Garden.
