<p><em>by Rachel Komich</em></p>
<p>Jack Johnson will headline the Kōkua for Kaua’i benefit concert on May 12 to help restore the community of Kaua’i after unprecedented rains caused widespread devastation on the Hawaiian island, leaving thousands of residents in need of support to rebuild their homes, businesses and farms.</p>
<p>The concert, which will also feature Donavon Frankenreiter, Paula Fuga, and Makana, will take place at the Poipu Beach Athletic Club in Kauai and directly benefit the displaced residents.</p>
<p>All of the proceeds will go to the Kauai Relief &amp; Recovery Fund at Hawai’i Community Foundation (HFC), a fund created to provide immediate relief such as shelter, healthcare, and food and water. HFC is the leading philanthropic institution in Hawaii and distributed more than $59 million in grants and contracts in 2017 alone.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting thousands of locals, the benefit show will be entirely plastic free. There will be no single-use plastic items available for purchase. Instead, beverages will be sold in cans, and all silverware will be compostable. Concert-goers are encouraged to bring their own reusable bottles to refill at water stations, part of the Zero Waste Kauai initiative.</p>

<p>Johnson, who grew up in Hawaii and is an avid supporter of several environmental causes, founded the Kokua Hawaii Foundation with his wife Kim. The foundation supports environmental education for children in Hawaiian schools and teaches them about good health &amp; nutrition in addition to environmental stewardship. Through his tours, albums and personal donations, he has given more than $30 million to charity since 2001.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant </em></p>
<p>Singer-songwriter and environmental activist Jack Johnson is back on the road for the first time since 2014 for a North American summer tour, which kicks off June 17 in Chicago and makes its way to the West Coast with a stop at the Hollywood Bowl on July 16.</p>
<p>Johnson’s 2017 tour will support more than140 non-profits through his environmental campaign and social action network, All At Once. One of the primary aims of Johnson’s tour is to provide greener alternatives during his shows in order to lessen their impacts on the environment and the cities in which he’s performing.</p>
<p>Since 2007, all of Johnson’s shows have offered concert-goers free water courtesy of water refill stations in order to curb the use of disposable plastic.</p>
<p>In 2014, the “Banana Pancakes” singer launched the Reusable Pint Program, an initiative designed to provide fans with alternatives to plastic cups and bottles. Instead, fans can purchase stainless steel cups, and as an added bonus, those who buy the cups receive discounts on beverage refills.</p>
<p>In addition, Johnson is implementing many other greening efforts in his 2017 summer tour. Sustainable bio-diesel tour vehicles, recycling, composting, and eco-friendly merchandise are just some of the programs that will help lessen the tour’s impact on the environment. The tour will also source local, organic food as part of a &#8220;farm to stage&#8221; program, offer alternative transportation incentives and bike valets.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Johnson has made environmental activism a top priority and uses his platform as a popular artist to make a difference. “Growing up [in Hawaii] I had a profound love for the natural world and the environment and the ocean,” <a href="http://musicforgood.tv/2016/03/jack-johnson-interview-the-musician-environmentalist-illustrates-how-easy-it-is-to-be-green/" target="_blank">Johnson told Music for Good</a> last year.</p>
<p>“As I got older, I found myself in this position [as a musician] where I suddenly had the ability to gather lots of people at once.” Since then, Johnson has creatively leveraged his public platform to inform people about how they can implement positive change in their communities, and has “walked the walk,” donating 100 percent of the profits from his tours between 2008-2013 to environmental nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>He also founded two nonprofits—<a href="http://www.johnsonohana.org/" target="_blank">Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation</a>, which supports charitable organizations that focus on the environment, art and music education, and <a href="https://kokuahawaiifoundation.org/" target="_blank">Kokua Hawaii Foundation</a>, which funds environmental education for schools in Hawaii and teaches children about health and nutrition.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>Jack Johnson has long been known for his laid-back, beachy vibes and his feel-good music. But beneath his calm surface and easy-going demeanor lies a very thoughtful, calculating artist and environmental activist who knows exactly what percentage of carbon emissions comes from fans traveling to his shows and has devised creative ways to make his tours more environmentally friendly while supporting great causes.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old singer was well on his way to a successful career as a professional surfer when he had a bad surfing accident at the age of 17, running into a coral reef and severely cutting up his face. As a result, he quit pro surfing and decided to pursue music. It ended up being a fantastic career move, as his 2001 debut album, <em>Brushfire Fairytales,</em> went platinum and paved the way for even greater success headlining major festivals, amassing a huge and loyal fanbase and releasing numerous hit albums.</p>
<p>All the while, Johnson has effectively used his platform as an artist to gather people together and champion the causes he deeply cares about. “Growing up [in Hawaii] I had a profound love for the natural world and the environment and the ocean,” Johnson tells Music for Good. “As I got older, I found myself in this position [as a musician] where I suddenly had the ability to gather lots of people at once.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_4243" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/KimJackJohnson_photo-KokuaHawaiiFoundation.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4243" title="KimJackJohnson_photo KokuaHawaiiFoundation" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/KimJackJohnson_photo-KokuaHawaiiFoundation-300x204.jpg" alt="Kim &amp; Jack Johnson. Photo: KokuaHawaiiFoundation" width="300" height="204" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/KimJackJohnson_photo-KokuaHawaiiFoundation-300x204.jpg 300w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/KimJackJohnson_photo-KokuaHawaiiFoundation.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kim &amp; Jack Johnson. Photo: KokuaHawaiiFoundation</p></div>
<p>Johnson’s wife, Kim – who was his college sweetheart – left her job as an educator to manage his tours in the early stages of his career. Working together they saw how they could use their unique position to affect positive change. “I took her out on the road with me, and we started to see that the potential to gather all these people and how to use that to affect these communities in a positive way,” Johnson recalls.</p>
<p>This desire to give back became even greater after Johnson was asked to perform at <a href="https://www.bridgeschool.org/concert/" target="_blank">Neil Young’s Bridge School Benefit</a>, an annual star-studded concert to support the School, which is dedicated to educating children with special needs. “Being invited to Neil Young’s Bridge School Benefit and seeing their strong community of musicians and whole team coming together to do something so positive for the community was really inspiring,” Johnson says. “Coming back to Hawaii we did the first Kokua Festival, inspired by the Bridge School Benefit. I had conversations with Pearl Jam, Neil Young and Willie Nelson, and found out what they were doing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Johnson had gone from playing small clubs and restaurants to headlining amphitheaters and major festivals. While most musicians would be thrilled about this, Johnson had a bit of an existential crisis when he realized the negative impact his tours were having on the environment.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeFJlk8eOhQ" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>“When you’re traveling in a van, your tour is low impact by nature,” he says. “[In the early days] all of our gear fit into one minivan and our impact was pretty low.” But then, as his tours and fanbase grew, so did the negative impact his tours were having on the environment. “A majority of emissions is from the fans coming to the shows,” he explains, admitting there was a time when he wasn’t sure he wanted to keep doing it because of this. Then he realized there was a way to reduce the harm and increase the good, and it made sense to him again.</p>
<p><span id="more-4234"></span></p>
<p>“We started getting the message out of ways that people can be creative to get to the shows,” he explains. “Take mass transit, ride their bikes, or carpooling. Any way you can cut down on the amount of vehicles…because 80-90% of emissions come from people traveling to the shows.” Johnson set up bike valets at his concerts and fun incentives for fans to carpool to his gigs. “We try to make things fun too,” he says. “We have a bike valet at all of our shows. Every time we come around it gets more popular and it gets attention in the local news!”</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 327px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0227_PhotoMaxTischler.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4246" title="IMG_0227_PhotoMaxTischler" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0227_PhotoMaxTischler-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="238" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0227_PhotoMaxTischler-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0227_PhotoMaxTischler-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jack Johnson shows off his customized reusable water bottle. Photo: Max Tischler</p></div>
<p>Johnson also requests that energy-efficient light bulbs be installed in the venues where he plays, and that filtered water dispensing stations are available so people can fill up their reusable water bottles to eliminate the use of plastic bottles and save his fans a few dollars. “My teenage fans shouldn’t have to pay a lot of money for water!” he says.</p>
<p>In addition to working with his fans to make his tours greener, Johnson also connects them with notable non-profits in the cities where he plays shows. “Now knowing that when we come through town, connections are made through non-profit groups and the younger generation who have the energy to get involved,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And now it feels that when we leave, we leave the towns in better shape.”</p>
<p>Johnson also donated a whopping 100% of the profits from his tours to non-profit organizations from 2008-2013. Through the <a href="http://johnsonohana.org/ " target="_blank">Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation</a> (ohana means family in Hawaiian), he works with a board to give this money out in grants to worthwhile charitable organizations. He also founded the <a href="http://kokuahawaiifoundation.org/home" target="_blank">Kokua Hawaii Foundation</a>, which supports environmental education for children in Hawaiian schools and teaches them about good health &amp; nutrition in addition to environmental stewardship. Johnson has been known to show up in classrooms to perform for the kids and teach them lessons in gardening, composting and nutrition.</p>
<p>The singer points out that music fans have more power than they realize when it comes to making sure the venues they visit, the musicians they love and the brands they support follow environmentally friendly practices.</p>
<p>“I’m inspired that a lot of people <em>do</em> want to make change,” Johnson says. “It’s easier to say, ‘This is how things are,’ than to change the industry in a way that closely represents the way you see the world. But now I see that fans are expecting it more and more. They’re a little more hip to the way things should be. They want to do the right thing. Fans have a lot more power than they realize. When fans demand these things, people listen!”</p>
<div id="attachment_4249" style="width: 368px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20130126_AINA_SBES_Garden_Party_KJ-34.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4249   " title="20130126_AINA_SBES_Garden_Party_KJ - 34" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20130126_AINA_SBES_Garden_Party_KJ-34.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="238" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20130126_AINA_SBES_Garden_Party_KJ-34.jpg 640w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20130126_AINA_SBES_Garden_Party_KJ-34-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jack Johnson builds a planter at a &quot;garden party&quot; for his Kokua Hawaii Foundation</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Johnson has been named a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for its Environment Programme, and has taken part in events such as embarking on a <a href="http://musicforgood.tv/2015/06/jack-johnson-joins-the-5-gyres-sea-change-expedition-to-spread-awareness-of-plastic-pollution-in-the-ocean/" target="_blank">boating expedition with the non-profit 5 Gyres</a> to draw attention to the dangers of single-use plastics and the threat it poses to our oceans while educating people about sustainable alternatives.</p>
<p>In addition to his activism, Johnson has started working on songs for the follow-up to his 2013 album, <em>From Here to Now to You,</em> and will headline the <a href="https://www.kaaboodelmar.com/" target="_blank">Kaaboo Festival</a> in San Diego, California in September. Although it’s the only show on the books for this year so far, Johnson says it’s likely that others will pop up. “I do tend to do shows I don’t know about until a week ahead of time,” he says with a laugh.</p>
<p>Johnson also points out that no matter how many fans a musician has, he or she can still make a real difference. “No matter what the size of the show, you have a platform,” Johnson says emphatically. “Even if it’s just a show at a restaurant for an organization like the <a href="https://www.surfrider.org/" target="_blank">Surfrider Foundation</a>, you can use music to bring people together and discuss ideas. You can get a non-profit to have a table [at your shows]. Even if only one table will fit, you can always find a way to shine a spotlight!”</p>

<p><em></em>A groundbreaking new exhibit at the California Science Center features several prominent musicians including Sting, Pharrell Williams, Jack Johnson, Sheryl Crow, Ziggy Marley and Willie Nelson, exploring how they use their public platform as artists to raise awareness of vital global environmental issues.</p>
<p>“Earth in Concert: Protecting the Planet Through Music” also features a multimedia exploration of tropical coral reefs, animal calls and habitats and examines the state of biodiversity in our oceans, grasslands and forests.</p>
<p>A new composition by Jack Johnson about reducing plastic pollution in the ocean is also a part of the exhibit, and museum-goers can contribute verses to the song to do their part to inspire people to action.</p>

<p>The exhibit, which is put on in partnership with the <a href="http://www.grammymuseum.org/" target="_blank">Grammy Museum</a> and the <a href="http://globalwildlife.org/" target="_blank">Global Wildlife Conservation</a>, kicked off with a star-studded concert featuring Ziggy Marley, Dwight Yokam and Judith Hill at Los Angeles&#8217; Club Nokia on November 11. All proceeds from the concert benefitted Global Wildlife Conservation and the Grammy Museum.</p>
<p>Johnson, who&#8217;s an avid surfer, has been an active environmental advocate for several years, often focusing his efforts on the world&#8217;s oceans and greening initiatives. He <a href="http://musicforgood.tv/2015/06/jack-johnson-joins-the-5-gyres-sea-change-expedition-to-spread-awareness-of-plastic-pollution-in-the-ocean/" target="_blank">recently joined non-profit 5 Gyres</a> to raise awareness of plastic pollution in the oceans and the deadly impact it has on marine life and ecosystems.</p>
<p>Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Crow goes to great lengths to reduce the environmental impact of her tours, and often addresses issues of global warming and alternative energy sources in her music. Reggae artist Marley has long been an advocate of treating the Earth with care, singing several pro-Earth anthems on his most recent album, <em>Fly Rasta</em>.</p>
<p>Country music veteran Nelson co-founded the long-running benefit concert Farm Aid to help American family farms, farmers and healthy, farm-fresh food in schools, and owns bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil rather than fossil fuels. Meanwhile Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, co-founded the <a href="http://www.rainforestfund.org" target="_blank">Rainforest Fund</a>, which protects forests and the indigenous people who live in them from exploitation and destruction.</p>
<p>Singer/producer Williams serves as creative director of Bionic Yarn, which uses recycled plastic to create yarn, and has <a href="http://rawfortheoceans.g-star.com" target="_blank">partnered with clothing brand G-Star Raw </a>to make stylish denim using plastic recycled from the ocean.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://californiasciencecenter.org/exhibits/special-exhibitions/earth-in-concert " target="_blank">Earth in Concert</a> exhibit will run for the next few weeks at the California Science Center and is free and open to the public.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>Singer-songwriter and long-time environmental activist Jack Johnson has joined the <a href="http://www.5gyres.org/" target="_blank">5 Gyres</a> non-profit organization on an expedition to spread awareness and educate people about plastics pollution in the world’s oceans.</p>
<p>On June 2, Johnson, alongside the 5 Gyres SEA Change Expedition crew, departed from Miami, FL on a journey to research the impacts of plastics on the aquatic ecosystem and marine life.</p>
<p>During the expedition, Johnson will become a Goodwill Ambassador for the <a href="http://www.unep.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Environment Programme</a>, and participate in the 5 Gyres SEA Change Youth Summit in the Bahamas to educate children, and explore solutions to the plastics pollution epidemic in the ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone who loves and lives in the ocean, I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to be participating in 5 Gyres&#8217; SEA Change Expedition and youth summit,&#8221; said Johnson. &#8220;I look forward to learning alongside the students, while helping to raise awareness of plastic free solutions and the importance of reducing our dependency on single-use plastics.&#8221;</p>
<p>On June 9, during the second leg of the expedition, Johnson and crew will embark on a week-long sail to Bermuda, mapping and collecting data to figure out the amount of plastics in this part of the ocean. They will collect data including mass, size, color and type of plastics in order to provide accurate information about the water pollution.</p>
<p><span id="more-3473"></span></p>
<p>Because of their ubiquitousness and widespread-use, plastics have become a major pollution problem in Earth’s oceans. According to the 5 Gyres website, only five to 10 percent of all produced plastics are recovered, and only 50 percent are buried in landfills and recycled into other goods. The rest of the plastic washes out to sea where it fails to biodegrade, leaving an estimated 270,000 metric tons of plastic in the oceans. The plastics then break down into smaller pieces, killing and sickening fish, turtles, and other marine life that ingest it.</p>
<p>These plastics also contain toxic chemicals, which are in turn ingested by humans who rely on fish and other marine life for food.</p>
<p>Johnson himself is no stranger to philanthropic work. The “Upside Down” singer founded the Johnson <a href="http://johnsonohana.org/ " target="_blank">Ohana Charitable Foundation</a> in 2008, which is a non-profit that supports environmental, art, and music education around the world.</p>
<p>5 Gyres is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing plastics pollution in the ocean. Founded by Charles J. Moore, the organization has launched 16 different expeditions gathering statistics and data about plastics in ocean and even helped pass legislation to reduce the use of plastic microbeads in hygiene products.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3237" title="alopress" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="221" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress.jpg 530w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/alopress-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /></a>By Billy Restivo</em></p>
<p>From Santa Barbara driveways to arenas and festivals all around the world, the guys in Animal Liberation Orchestra (ALO) have been infecting audiences with a vibrant, groovy rock that seems almost indigenous to their native Golden State. Now, after more than two decades and four studio albums together, they’re heading out on their Tour d’Amour, celebrating love, breezy tunes, old friends, and new faces.</p>
<p>In typical ALO fashion, the band will donate a portion of the proceeds from the tour – which will hit 11 cities throughout their home state of California – to non-profit organizations that work to bring music to children.</p>
<p>Music for Good caught up with vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Zach Gill to discuss just how far the group’s good vibes are spreading. Although the band has typically supported national organizations, those doing good work closer to home are never out of the question. “I think picking an actual school from our local zone just felt like a good fit,” says Gill, who helped name San Francisco’s Creative Arts Charter School the associated organization of Tour d’Amour IX.</p>
<p>As products of high school music programs themselves, Gill, along with bassist, Steve Adams, drummer, Dave Brogan, and guitarist, Dan “Lebo” Lebowitz now get the chance to help the Creative Arts Charter School provide hands-on, arts-integrated public education to Bay Area students.</p>
<p>“I was so happy when I found music because I wasn’t really too good at anything else,” Gill explains with a chuckle. “I don’t know what I would’ve done if I didn’t find music… and so I just feel like it’s good to give kids with a mind for that sort of thing the option and the outlet.”</p>
<p>Among the other organizations ALO have contributed to in the past are <a href="http://notesfornotes.org/" target="_blank">Notes for Notes</a>, which designs and equips after-school recording studios inside <a href="http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank">Little Kids Rock</a>, a group that provides free music classes and instruments to students across the country.</p>
<div id="attachment_3243" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3243" title="Jack &amp; ALO" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO-300x168.jpg 300w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jack-ALO-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jack Johnson on stage with ALO</p></div>
<p>Gill and his bandmates have also worked closely in their philanthropic endeavors with longtime friend (and fellow UCSB graduate) Jack Johnson, whose organization, the <a href="http://johnsonohana.org/" target="_blank">Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation</a>, has made significant contributions to environmental, art, and music education worldwide. “I think there was always that [philanthropic] component to our music and Jack’s music,” says Gill. “If you’re going to get a bunch of people together, it’d be cool if it wasn’t just partying for partying sake.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s label, Brushfire Records, has also been pivotal to the band’s growth, according to Gill. Since the 2006 re-release of Fly Between Falls, Brushfire has put out three ALO albums and exposed international audiences to hits like “Girl, I Wanna Lay You Down” and “Blew Out The Walls.”</p>
<p>And so ALO continue to party for one good cause after another, leaving behind a rather contagious happy-go-lucky attitude every step of the way. One might ask what’s next for the California-born jam band vets; Gill’s thinking a new record (this autumn, possibly), more touring, and even a little benefit concert for a handful of lucky Santa Barbara grade-schoolers.</p>

<p><em>By Travis Clark</em></p>
<p>This Election Day, HeadCount.org and more than 300 entertainers will work together in a massive campaign to get fans to vote. Using the hashtag #GoVote, the campaign aims to get more people out for the midterm elections on November 4.</p>
<p>The non-partisan voting organization  recognizes the likelihood of “drop-off” voting, where people ignore the midterm elections in favor of only voting in presidential ones. But with this new campaign, the hopes of getting more voters out this year are high.</p>
<p>Renowned musicians including Jack Johnson, &#8220;Weird Al&#8221; Yankovich, Jason Mraz, Neko Case, The Head and the Heart, Rise Against, Primus&#8217; Les Claypool, Michael Franti, Andrew Bird, The Antlers, Drive-By-Truckers, Local Natives, Dr. Dog, and Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeroes are taking part in the motivating campaign, along with other entertainers including Conan O&#8217;Brien, Stephen Colbert, Sarah Silverman and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StephenColbertGoVote.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3024" title="StephenColbertGoVote" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StephenColbertGoVote.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StephenColbertGoVote.jpg 200w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StephenColbertGoVote-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>This illustrious group is tweeting and Instagraming photos of themselves holding artwork that says “#GoVote.” The average number of Twitter followers for each artist is one million, meaning the campaign will reach millions of fans and potential voters.<br />
HeadCount curated art from many of the best rock poster artists for the entertainers to pose with. Much of this artwork can be found <a href="http://govote.org" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>HeadCount is a non-partisan organization that works with musicians to promote democracy. They come out to concerts to rally young voters with voter registration drives, and hold special events to promote voting and getting your voice heard. Their goal: to make voting fun through the power of music.</p>
<p>“The incumbent Congress is the least popular in history, so we can&#8217;t leave it to the candidates alone to inspire people,” says Marc Brownstein, HeadCount’s co-founder and bass player in The Disco Biscuits. “We&#8217;re trying to get the message across that being dissatisfied is a bad reason not to vote – it&#8217;s the exact reason why participation is so important.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p><em></em>For many artists, touring means a chance to see different cities and meet fans from all walks of life. For Jack Johnson, it brings an opportunity to effect change on a local level while mobilizing communities to support local farms.</p>
<p>Although the chart-topping singer/songwriter and longtime environmental activist runs his own <a href="http://kokuahawaiifoundation.org/">Kokua Hawaii Foundation</a>, Johnson’s <em>From Here To Now To You</em> tour will support the work of other local and national nonprofit organizations that focus on sustainable agriculture, food access, farm-to-school projects, and other food policy issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;While on tour we are lucky to be able to enjoy food from every region that we visit,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Supporting local farmers at each stop is important to us. Along the way we have met many amazing non-profit groups that promote local, organic, and sustainable food in their communities and schools. Food Day is a great opportunity to introduce people to these groups who are doing important work and celebrate our connection to food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout Johnson&#8217;s fall tour dates across Europe and North America, fans will be able to connect with non-profits in their communities and share their commitment to local food on <a href="http://www.allatonce.org">AllAtOnce.org</a>. These <a href="http://www.foodday.org/partner_organizations">partner organizations</a> include <a href="http://www.farmaid.org/">Farm Aid</a>, <a href="http://www.change.org">Change.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/">Slow Food USA</a> and a suite of local organizations and chef groups.</p>
<p>The tour culminates just before the third annual <a href="http://www.foodday.org/">Food Day</a> on October 24. Food Day supports thousands of events in all 50 states promote healthy, affordable, and sustainably produced food. This year, organizers will focus on encouraging children to cook and asking adults who can cook to pass on their skills. While Food Day won’t accept funding from government or industry, they do encourage forward-thinking companies to host events.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Johnson&#8217;s sixth studio album, <em>From Here To Now To You</em>, hit Number 1 on the Billboard charts.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://jackjohnsonmusic.com/tour" target="_blank">Johnson&#8217;s website</a> to find tour dates near you, then <a href="http://www.foodday.org/">find out how you can get involved with Food Day</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a rare treat when a musician who headlines massive festivals decides to perform at a series of smaller venues to give his fans a more intimate experience. Rarer still is a musician who gives the proceeds from ticket sales to a suite of charities across the US and Europe.</p>
<p>On the heels of his headline performance at the Life is Good Festival on September 22, Jack Johnson will celebrate the release of his forthcoming album, &#8220;From Here To Now To You,&#8221; with a tour through some of the most historic seated theaters in North America. These include Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium, Seattle’s Paramount Theatre and the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles. What&#8217;s more, the famed singer-songwriter will donate a whopping 100% of his tour profits to charity.</p>
<p>Johnson’s tour will promote the <a href="http://allatonce.org/" target="_blank">All At Once campaign</a>, which seeks to create global change through individual action. This year’s campaign focuses on engaging fans to take action in support of sustainable local food systems and plastic-free initiatives. Through All At Once, the tour will support more than 75 hand-selected community groups across Europe and North America with direct and matching donations. These include local chapters of <a href="http://www.surfrider.org/" target="_blank">Surfrider</a>, <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/" target="_blank">Sierra Club</a>, <a href="http://www.buylocalvirginia.org/" target="_blank">Buy Fresh Buy Local</a> and <a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/" target="_blank">Slow Food USA</a> as well as San Francisco’s marine debris research non-profit <a href="http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.aspx" target="_blank">Project Kaisei</a> and Santa Barbara’s <a href="http://www.orfaleafoundation.org/focus-areas/education/school-food" target="_blank">School Food Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Johnson has teamed up with <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/" target="_blank">Reverb</a> to <a href="http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/greening" target="_blank">continue paving the way in green touring practices</a> and community engagement initiatives. The crew has said goodbye to backstage single-use water bottles and hello to tour vehicles that run on domestic sustainable biodiesel. Fans can rest assured knowing mass transportation options will be available and that dining options will stock local food, fresh from farm to stage.</p>
<p>Even when he’s not touring, Johnson has long supported environmental and educational initiatives. In 2008, he founded the <a href="http://johnsonohana.org/home/" target="_blank">Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation</a> with his wife Kim to promote positive and lasting change within communities by supporting organizations that focus on environmental, art, and music education.</p>
<p><strong>From Here to Now To You</strong> will be released September 17 through Johnson’s own Brushfire Records. You can hear the album’s first single, “I Got You,” <a href="http://bit.ly/13truQ6" target="_blank">here</a>. Find tour dates leading up to the release, as well as his post-release intimate theater series, below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/FarmAid.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-736" title="FarmAid" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/FarmAid-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/FarmAid-300x199.jpg 300w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/FarmAid.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p>Despite America&#8217;s rich heritage as an agrarian republic, farmers continue to struggle. Fortunately, influential musicians remain allies to the families that feed the country. In 1987, soon after Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, and Neil Young launched the first Farm Aid benefit concert, Congress passed the Agricultural Credit Act to help protect family farms from foreclosure.</p>
<p>Since then, the <a href="http://www.farmaid.org/" target="_blank">Farm Aid </a>organization has continued to grow, raising money for struggling farmers as well as providing those impacted by natural disasters with food, financial help, legal advice and psychological assistance. This year, Mellencamp, Nelson, and Young return with Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson and other artists at Hersheypark Stadium in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Nelson, who now serves as president of Farm Aid, noted just how relevant family farmers&#8217; struggle is in a time already darkened by income disparity in America, saying, &#8220;Farm Aid brings…Main Street values to transform the Wall Street-controlled farm and food system. The Farm Aid concert is our chance to shine a spotlight on the independent family farmers who are essential to the well-being of our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farm Aid 2012&#8217;s lineup also includes Dave Matthews Band guitarist <a href="http://www.timreynolds.com/" target="_blank">Tim Reynolds</a> California rock bands <a href="http://www.alomusic.com/" target="_blank">ALO</a>, <a href="http://www.promiseofthereal.com/" target="_blank">Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real</a>, and <a href="http://www.pegiyoung.com/" target="_blank">Pegi Young and the Survivors</a>, fronted by Neil Young&#8217;s wife and former backup singer.</p>
<p>The funds raised from ticket sales will go toward promoting <a href="http://www.farmaid.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=qlI5IhNVJsE&amp;b=6281749&amp;ct=11693495&amp;notoc=1&amp;msource=homepage" target="_blank">food from family farms </a>fostering connections between farmers and consumers by getting family farm food in urban grocery stores, restaurants and schools; running the crisis hotline 1-800-FARM-AID and the <a href="http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.3744949/k.ED8F/Network_Search_Tool.htm" target="_blank">Farmer Resource Network</a>; and working to promote fair farm policies regarding topics like factory farms and genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p>Tickets go on sale Friday, July 13 at 10 a.m. ET. You can grab them <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/020048E5854D3468?crosssite=LN_US:704939:16394" target="_blank">here</a>.
