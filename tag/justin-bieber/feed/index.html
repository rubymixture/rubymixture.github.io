<p><em>By Jay Corliss<br />
</em></p>
<p>Since the tragic school shooting in Parkland, FL last month, students from Parkland School and young people across the country have been advocating for stricter gun control laws and calling for an end to gun violence. Their movement, March For Our Lives, has generated many social media posts, walkouts, and debates about gun laws.</p>
<p>Now it seems that their efforts are inspiring musicians to take a stance on the issue. On March 2, Harry Styles tweeted his support by saying, &#8220;I just signed the @AMarch4OurLives petition, and you should too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The petition precedes the March For Our Lives event on March 24 and outlines the reforms that students will demand from lawmakers as they descend on Washington, DC and various state capitals.</p>
<p>Other musicians who have signed the petition include Hayley Williams from Paramore, St. Vincent, Justin Bieber, and Fifth Harmony&#8217;s Lauren Jauregui.</p>
<p>Recently, Sophie Hawley-Weld from emerging dance-pop duo Sofi Tukker also showed her support for the movement by rocking a March For Our Lives Sticker on her guitar strap during a <em>Conan</em> performance.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrRi1z8_59I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Rock band Incubus are also encouraging fans join the March for Our Lives event, and are offering the chance to win tickets to the upcoming In Bloom Festival in Houston and meet the band <a href="https://www.propeller.la/inbloom">via Propeller</a> by taking action and joining the movement to end gun violence in schools.</p>
<p>“As a band, we are so amazed and in awe of the young humans who have responded to the Parkland School shooting last month in Florida,” Incubus said in a statement. “We support you and we are so grateful for your courage and perseverance in organizing March For Our Lives and rallying the country to help end gun violence.”</p>

<p>Charity auctions, a longtime hallmark of the holiday season, wouldn&#8217;t be complete without both legendary and contemporary artists using their starpower to get people into a charitable mood. Now a fundraising site called <a href="http://www.charitybuzz.com/" target="_blank">Charitybuzz</a> is helping organizations reach a much larger audience through partnerships with nonprofits as diverse as WhyHunger and Tibet House.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whyhunger.org/" target="_blank">WhyHunger</a> is a leader in building the movement to end hunger and poverty by connecting people to nutritious, affordable food and by supporting grassroots solutions that inspire self-reliance and community empowerment. The organization runs the only national hunger hotline as well as Artists Against Hunger &amp; Poverty, a program that partners with artists, the music community and the music industry to raise awareness and funds for community-based anti-hunger organizations.</p>
<p>Now, the artists are giving back to WhyHunger in support of the organization&#8217;s <a href="http://www.charitybuzz.com/auctions/whyhunger/catalog_items" target="_blank">Hungerthon online auction</a> on Charitybuzz. Mariah Carey donated an autographed tambourine and box set, and several musicians have autographed guitars for the event, including Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Mumford and Sons, Taylor Swift and Def Leppard. Additionally, bidders will have the opportunity to win lunch with Marky Ramone, Willie Nelson tickets, and a chance to meet Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>WhyHunger isn&#8217;t the only charity finding success on Charitybuzz this holiday season.<br />
<a href="http://www.tibethouse.org/" target="_blank"> Tibet House</a>, a non-profit educational institution and cultural embassy, has launched an <a href="http://www.charitybuzz.com/support/115" target="_blank">online auction</a> that will run through December 19. The organization will also host its 10th annual benefit auction on December 18 at Christie&#8217;s Auction House in New York City.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tibet-house-logo.gif"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1313" title="tibet-house-logo" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tibet-house-logo-150x150.gif" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Both Yoko Ono and Sting have pledged their support for the organization, which works to promote and preserve Tibet&#8217;s unique cultural and spiritual heritage. They join <em>Rolling Stone</em> founder Jann Wenner and a cast of Hollywood celebrities on the Honorary Chair Committee. Available items include an internship at <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine, a guitar signed by Sting, and two VIP tickets to Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival 2013.</p>
<p>Still looking for that perfect gift? Check out the available memorabilia, tickets, and opportunities to meet artists available on <a href="http://www.charitybuzz.com/" target="_blank">Charitybuzz.com</a> to support one of more than 100 organizations represented on the site.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BieberSparksUsherFurtado.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-501" title="BieberSparksUsherFurtado" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BieberSparksUsherFurtado-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BieberSparksUsherFurtado-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BieberSparksUsherFurtado.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Pop stars Justin Bieber, Nelly Furtado, Usher and Jordin Sparks have teamed up with the Billboard Music Awards to raise funds and increase awareness of their favorite charities in a unique competition. Each musician has been actively involved in supporting the works of non-profit organizations whose missions range from fostering youth leadership to encouraging young people to give back to their communities, and they&#8217;re asking the public to vote on their favorite causes.</p>
<p>Usher explains that through the <a href="http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx">Boys and Girls Club</a>, he met strong role models who made a real difference in his life. These experiences inspired him to start his own <a href="http://www.ushersnewlook.org/ ">New Look Foundation</a> so he could return the favor. “I started the New Look Foundation when I saw I could motivate youth through what I was doing,” Usher explains. “But there had to be something specific that would be helpful for them. And that was preparing them to be future leaders and giving them an opportunity they didn’t see.” Usher hopes his organization will help inspire future leaders to see beyond their present circumstances to great possibilities.</p>
<p>Furtado has been giving back to her community since she was a kid, whether it was playing ukulele for the elderly or working with special needs children. Now, as an ambassador for <a href=" http://www.freethechildren.com/">Free the Children</a>, she is encouraging young people to find ways to give back. “If you look around in your community, no matter where you live or what you do, there’s always something you can do to help,” she says. “When I met Free The Children last year, I felt I’d joined forces with a group that I could be really passionate about.  Free The Children is all about children raising money for other children in other places…some of their largest donations come from schools that are in at-risk communities all over North America.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bieber says he makes a regular practice of finding creative ways to give back. “If I’m not giving back, I don’t think I’m doing my job,&#8221; he says. Bieber regularly donates a portion of his ticket sales to worthy causes, and makes a habit of visiting children’s hospitals and helping to make kids’ dreams come true through the <a href="http://www.wish.org/">Make A Wish Foundation</a>. He also supports <a href="http://www.pencilsofpromise.org/">Pencils of Promise</a>, which increases access to quality education in high-need communities throughout Laos, Nicaragua and Guatemala.</p>
<p>Finally, Sparks says she uses her celebrity platform for good, “or else what good is it?” She supports the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ImMADAreYou/info">M.A.D. </a>(Making A Difference) campaign, which is a charitable campaign Sparks started with her brother, P.J., to motivate people to find something they’re passionate about and find a way to make a difference. “You see something and you get mad about it and it stirs your spirit,” she says.</p>
<p>To vote on your favorite non-profit organization, click <a href=" http://www.billboard.com/bbma/news/giving-feels-good-pleasure-philanthropy">here</a>. The organization that gets the most votes will receive $20,000, and you’ll have a chance to win a trip to the 2012 Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas on May 20.</p>
