<p>Metallica is launching a national community service initiative dedicated to improving the communities that have been part of their journey for so many years. The band’s All Within My Hands foundation, launched last year, has declared May 23 as Metallica Day of Service, encouraging fans to go out and volunteer with local food banks to help fight nationwide hunger.</p>
<p>Last summer during their tour, the band contributed to local charity partners in each city they performed in including <a href="https://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Kids Rock</a>, <a href="https://www.grammy.com/musicares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusiCares </a>and <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America</a>. Now they’re encouraging people to get involved by volunteering in their communities.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://allwithinmyhands.org/blog/news/452442/join-all-within-my-hands-to-help-out-in-your-commu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of foodbanks here</a> and find one to volunteer with in your area. If those are out of reach, Metallica suggests visiting the <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America website</a> to find a nearby food bank. Volunteers who register to pitch in on Metallica’s Day of Service will be given an All Within My Hands t-shirt.</p>

<p><em>By Kennedi Johnson</em></p>
<p>The music community is a tight-knit group, so it comes as no surprise that there’s an organization created by music people for music people. This organization, the <a href="https://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares Foundation</a>, recently launched an innovative social media campaign, the #MusiCaresChallenge, to encourage people to support musicians in need by posing with their favorite albums.</p>
<p>The challenge asks music fans and musicians to take a snap or a video of themselves holding their favorite album, and post it to social media with the hashtag #MusiCaresChallenge. Those participating can then make a donation to the MusiCares Foundation and tag five friends to join in on the challenge.</p>
<div id="attachment_4450" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lumineers2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4450" title="lumineers2" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lumineers2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lumineers2.jpg 200w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lumineers2-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Lumineers support the MusiCares Challenge</p></div>
<p>Pop star Demi Lovato championed the cause by posting a picture of herself with her current favorite album, Beyoncé’s <em>Lemonade</em>. In addition to Lovato, several other celebrities are lending their time and support to the campaign including Troye Sivan, Andra Day, The Lumineers, The Avett Brothers, and the Backstreet Boys.</p>
<p>All proceeds from the campaign will be directed to those in need within the music community. To watch a video detailing the challenge and showcasing the celebrities involved, click <a href="http://hyperurl.co/MCChallengeVideo" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Described as the “music industry’s Red Cross,” the MusiCares Foundation is a non-profit founded by the Recording Academy to provide critical assistance and healthcare programs for members of the music community, including addiction recovery support and disaster relief. To date, MusiCares has provided more than $43 million in services and helped approximately 80,000 people.</p>
<p>Although it’s primarily known for the annual Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy has long been committed to lending a helping hand to members of the musical world in need.

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em></p>
<p>Have you ever dreamt of wearing your favorite rock star’s beaten and battered leather jacket or the boots that have walked across countless stages? Now you can come pretty close, because <a href="http://www.nixon.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Nixon</a> – a boutique wristwatch and accessories brand – is releasing its Rock LTD Collection featuring watches with leather straps made out of boots, jackets and other clothes worn by legendary rock musicians including Keith Richards, Ringo Starr, Tom Waits, Ozzy Osbourne and The Who frontman Pete Townshend.</p>
<p>Proceeds from sales of the watches will go to the <a href="https://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares MAP Fund</a> – a charity created by The Recording Academy dedicated to assisting musicians who are suffering from addiction.</p>
<p>“I know firsthand about the ravages of addiction,” Black Sabbath frontman Osbourne told <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/how-watchmaker-turning-rock-icons-clothes-classic-timepieces-167709" target="_blank">AdWeek</a>. “I also know that the MusiCares MAP Fund is a vital safety net for people in the music industry.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nixon-watches.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3892" title="Nixon watches" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nixon-watches-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nixon-watches-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nixon-watches.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Rolling Stones guitarist Richards donated an old leather jacket to the initiative, and Waits gave a pair of old leather boots. Former Beatles drummer Starr donated a piece of leather from his drum bag, and Eddie Van Halen donated a guitar strap. Townshend wanted to further personalize his timepiece, and added The Who’s logo to the watch.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to reach out to an artist and not ask him to perform,” said MusiCares’ Wynnie Wynn. “Instead, all they have to do is reach into the closet to produce an item that can raise significant funds.”</p>
<p>Each watch will cost between $1,000 and $4,000, and will be sold worldwide starting in mid-November at retailers such as Fred Segal, Barneys and Selfridges. The watches will not be available online, so fans will have to purchase these rare items in person.</p>
<p>Celebrities such as Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, Tony Hawk, Metallica’s James Hetfield, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis have donated to previous Nixon LTD collections, which also benefited MusiCares MAP Fund.</p>
<p>Nixon does not receive any monetary profit from the Rock LTD line, with all of the proceeds being donated to the charity.</p>
<p>MusiCares offers addiction recovery and support centers in Los Angeles, Nashville, Austin, New Orleans, New York, Seattle and Colorado. To learn more about MusiCare’s MAP Fund, click <a href="https://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em><strong></strong></p>
<p>Along with a stellar lineup featuring the likes of Paul McCartney, Metallica, Florence and the Machine, Flying Lotus, Alt-J and A$AP Rocky, Lollapalooza is once again focusing on giving back to the community by running its annual Lolla Cares initiative – a showcase of several fantastic non-profit organizations that the festival supports.</p>
<p>If you’re attending the Grant Park extravaganza taking place July 31-August 2, be sure to stop by some of the booths and check out these great causes. And if you can&#8217;t attend the festival, be sure to visit these organizations&#8217; websites and catch live-streamed performances on<a href="http://www.lollapalooza.com/updates/2015-livestream-schedule/" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://lollapalooza.redbull.tv/" target="_blank">Red Bull TV</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagocares.org/">Chicago Cares</a></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Chicago Cares works to build a stronger community by addressing issues including hunger, education, poverty and job readiness. These services are especially essential in a city that saw 432 murders in 2014, boasting one of the highest murder rates in the country. Founded in 1991 by Leslie Bluhm and Mary Prchal, the organization has amassed 500,000 volunteers, and is one of Chicago’s leading non-profits. Chicago Cares has created tens of thousands of programs to educate and empower volunteers to help shape the future of their community.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.headcount.org/" target="_blank">HeadCount </a></strong></p>
<p>HeadCount returns to Lolla this year to help register voters of all ages. The organization, founded in 2004, is focused on working with musicians and concerts in order to convince the masses to register and vote. HeadCount aims to persuade people to participate in politics, and stresses the importance of voting in order to make a direct impact on the community. The organization has registered more than 300,000 voters since 2004, and travels around the country staging voter registration drives at various music events.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://lovehopestrength.org/" target="_blank">Love Hope Strength Foundation</a> </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3640" title="Green Street" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Love Hope Strength is a cancer foundation promoting outreach and awareness programs for cancer victims, survivors and their families. In 2007, LHSF hosted the world’s highest concert on land at Mount Everest, gaining an audience of over 3 million through the internet and an MTV documentary. LHSF builds and funds cancer centers around the world, and is supported by several musicians including Wilco, The Doobie Brothers and Jason Mraz.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.meatfreemondays.com/" target="_blank">Meat Free Monday</a> </strong></p>
<p>2015 Lollapalooza headliner Paul McCartney and his daughters Mary &amp; Stella McCartney helped launch Meat Free Monday in 2009, which is a not-for-profit campaign dedicated to raising awareness about the health and environmental impacts of eating meat. The initiative, supported by celebrities such as Gwenyth Paltrow and Ricky Gervais, encourages people to refrain from eating meat at least once a week.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares </a></strong></p>
<p>MusiCares, established by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, provides musicians with financial and medical aid in their times of need, and treats each case with full confidentiality. The foundation offers programs such as emergency financial assistance, senior housing, outreach, and drug rehabilitation.</p>
<p><span id="more-3636"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.one.org/us/" target="_blank">ONE</a> </strong></p>
<p>ONE, co-founded by U2’s Bono, is an advocacy and international campaigning organization fighting to end extreme poverty, hunger, and preventable diseases around the world—namely in Africa, and raises public and political awareness to combat life-threatening issues such as AIDS. The organization has seen a number of successes in its advocacy efforts, and currently 9 million people in Africa today have access to AIDS medication &#8212; up from 50,000 in 2002. In previous years, ONE’s booth at Lollapalooza offered festival-goers the opportunity to write postcards to their representatives, asking them to support and advocate the Electrify Africa Act, which aims to provide electricity to 50 million people in sub-Saharan Arica.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/" target="_blank">Oxfam America</a> </strong></p>
<p>Like ONE, Oxfam America is another organization combatting extreme poverty in developing countries. The Chicago chapter of Oxfam American will represent the organization at Lollapalooza, encouraging fans to fight against global poverty and injustice. The music-savvy charity released a free Summer Jams mixtape (http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/volunteer/concerts-festivals/oxfam-summer-jams-2015/) earlier this year, featuring tracks from Mew, Father John Misty, Ra Ra Riot and more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.peta.org/" target="_blank">PETA</a></strong></p>
<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is arguably the largest animal rights organization in the world, and has amassed more than 3 million members and supporters. The organization has received tons of media attention since its founding in 1980, and is endorsed by countless celebrities. It primarily focuses on protecting animals from factory farms, the clothing trade, laboratories, and harmful entertainment industry practices.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://rockthevote.com/" target="_blank">Rock the Vote</a></strong></p>
<p>Rock the Vote is the largest non-profit organization that specifically aims on encouraging young people to flex their political power and vote. The organization fuses pop culture with politics, making voting more enticing and accessible to younger audiences. Founded in 1990, Rock the Vote has helped encourage youth to create political and social change for 25 years through television campaigns and appearances at pop culture events. Rock the Vote has processed nearly 7 million voter registrations since its inception.</p>
<p><strong>Soberside </strong></p>
<p>Soberside is an initiative comprised of clean and sober music fans who choose to remain sober (alcohol and drug free) at music festivals. The tent will be on-sight at Lolla for any music fans who choose to remain sober during the festivities.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sydrocks.com/" target="_blank">Syd Rocks</a></strong></p>
<p>Syd Rocks is a Chicago-based foundation that raises awareness and funds research for Langerhan’s Cell Histiocytosis, a rare disease of the bone marrow and lymph nodes—primarily affecting children. Syd Rocks will be selling necklaces, t-shirts, hats and bracelets at Lollapalooza to raise funds for its cause.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sydrocks.com/" target="_blank">Working Bikes </a></strong></p>
<p>Working Bikes will be at Lollapalooza for the fourth year in a row. The organization is dedicated to rescuing discarded bikes and redistributing them to impoverished communities. Throughout the years, the organization has shipped thousands of donated bicycles to countries including El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua, South Africa and Ghana. The Chicago-based organization also donates bikes to poor and homeless people throughout the city. This year, the organization will have a booth offering music fans the chance to try out their bike machines.</p>

<p>A collection of world-renowned artists will descend on New York’s Best Buy Theater come May 28, when the MusiCares MAP Fund presents The Who’s singer/songwriter Pete Townshend and longtime manager Bill Curbishley with honorary awards.</p>
<p>The Boss himself, multi-Grammy-winning artist Bruce Springsteen, will present Townshend with the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the organization’s 11th annual benefit concert. Doug Morris, CEO of Sony Music Entertainment, will honor Curbishley with the MusiCares From the Heart Award.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/musicares-logo.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3388" title="musicares-logo" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/musicares-logo-271x300.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="192" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/musicares-logo-271x300.jpg 271w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/musicares-logo.jpg 499w" sizes="(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px" /></a>Both honorees have shown remarkable dedication and support to the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares Foundation</a> in its efforts to provide access to addiction recovery treatments and sober living resources for members of the music community. Since its establishment in 1989, the foundation has become a leading advocate for addiction recovery, offering networks through <a href="http://www.grammy.org/news/musicares-hosts-safe-harbor-rooms-in-various-cities" target="_blank">Safe Harbor Rooms </a>and holding weekly support groups for those learning to cope with the issues surrounding the recovery process.</p>
<p>The Who will also take the stage to perform at the benefit, featuring John Corey on grand piano, Loren Gold on keys, Pino Palladino on bass, Frank Simes on keyboard, Zak Starkey on drums, and Pete Townshend and Simon Townshend on guitars. Other performers on the night will include English punk veteran Billy Idol, Joan Jett, Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones, and others that have yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the show will benefit the MusiCares MAP Fund, with support from both RBC Capital Markets and the DJ AM Memorial Fund. The latter of the two, inspired by the late Adam “DJ AM” Goldstein, has provided crucial financial support to MusiCares since 2011 as a means to continue DJ AM’s commitment to sobriety and helping others free themselves of the stigma and challenges of substance abuse.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro<br />
</em>When most people hear the word NAMM, they think of the popular trade shows that feature an abundance of music gear and instruments, and the musicians who love them jamming out in busy convention center halls. But what most people don&#8217;t realize is that NAMM (the National Association of Music Merchants) has a strong charitable component with a mission to strengthen the music industry.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nammfoundation.org/" target="_blank">NAMM Foundation </a>works to advance participation in music and promotes the benefits and pleasures of making music by supporting scientific research, philanthropic giving and public service programs. It does this in various ways with the support of 10,000 members in 99 countries who help fund and promote its efforts.</p>
<p>For example, the NAMM Foundation recently supported a study of students participating in the <a href="http://turnaroundarts.pcah.gov/" target="_blank">Turnaround Arts</a>, designed to help turn around low-performing schools, narrow the achievement gap, and increase student engagement through the arts. Eight participating schools in the Washington, D.C. area were observed for the <a href="http://pcah.gov/sites/default/files/Turnaround%20Arts%20Phase%201%20Final%20Evaluation_Full%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">study</a>. Incredibly, of the eight schools, seven improved their reading proficiency rates and six improved their math proficiency rates. All eight schools improved in at least math or reading. Half of the schools improved their attendance rates significantly, and more than half of the schools dramatically reduced suspensions.</p>
<p>The NAMM Foundation also provides free musical instruments and donations to music education programs across the country, and recently visited John Marshall Elementary School in Anaheim, Calif. to deliver guitars, drums, ukuleles and more. Several NAMM members and brands who were in town for the January trade show including Kala Brand Music Co., Remo, Daisy Rock Girl Guitar, Alfred Music, Music and Arts, Rhythm Band Instruments and GAMA, came out to show their support of the Anaheim City School District&#8217;s reintroduction of music education programs into the curriculum.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, NAMM invited several notable music-centric charities to their winter trade show and get the word out about their valuable work.</p>
<div id="attachment_3164" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John-Lennon-tour-bus.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3164" title="John Lennon tour bus" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John-Lennon-tour-bus-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John-Lennon-tour-bus-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John-Lennon-tour-bus.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The John Lennon Educational Tour Bus gives demos at NAMM. Photo: Laura Ferreiro</p></div>
<p>As in previous years, the <a href="http://www.lennonbus.org/" target="_blank">John Lennon Education Tour Bus </a>parked outside the Anaheim Convention Center to offer tours to kids and musicians and give people a glimpse of their state-of-the art, mobile recording studio. The non-profit offers students the chance to write and record music with high-quality equipment and music professionals at no charge. The Bus celebrated its 18th year with a party featuring a raucous performance by George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic. Clinton also mentored students who were on hand from Berklee College of Music.</p>
<div id="attachment_3165" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MusiCares-CeeLo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3165" title="MusiCares CeeLo" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MusiCares-CeeLo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MusiCares-CeeLo-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MusiCares-CeeLo.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">CeeLo Green shows support for MusiCares. Photo: Laura Ferreiro</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares</a> set up shop at NAMM to help spread the word about their valuable work providing assistance to musicians in times of need. Renowned musicians such as CeeLo Green stopped by the booth to show their support. MusiCares also set up a Safe Harbor Room at NAMM where conference attendees could go to get support, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, or just relax.</p>
<div id="attachment_3167" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Steel-Panther.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3167" title="Steel Panther" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Steel-Panther-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Steel-Panther-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Steel-Panther.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steel Panther rock like a hurricane at the NAMMJAM 2015</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hobmusicforward.org/" target="_blank">House of Blues Music Forward Foundation</a> not only told NAMM-goers about their work educating youth on the role of music and culture in social change and creating performance opportunities for young and emerging musicians, but they also offered one of NAMM&#8217;s hottest tickets. The NAMMJAM at the Grove of Anaheim featured a performance by glam metal rockers Steel Panther joined by KISS guitarist Tommy Thayer and former Megadeath guitarist Marty Friedman. A silent auction with plenty of music paraphernalia donated by musicians benefitted the charity.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p><em></em>Foo Fighters have announced their first show of 2015 and it&#8217;s a doozy. In addition to the fact that it will be their final show in Southern California before they embark on their Sonic Highways world tour on January 15, the concert will also benefit three incredible charities.</p>
<p>The show will take place January 10 at the Los Angeles Forum, and a large percentage of ticket sales proceeds will go to support three music charities: Sweet Relief, Rock School Scholarship Fund and MusiCares.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sweetrelief.org/" target="_blank"> Sweet Relief </a>is a renowned non-profit that provides financial assistance to career musicians in need. <a href="http://rockschoolfund.org/" target="_blank">The Rock School Scholarship Fund</a> provides scholarship funds and instruments for children ages 7 to 17 who want to attend rock music schools throughout the United States. <a href="http://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares</a>, a charitable arm of the Recording Academy, provides a safety net of critical assistance for music people in times of need. MusiCares&#8217; services and resources cover a wide range of financial, medical and personal emergencies.</p>
<p>Dave Grohl and company are scheduled to return to the LA Forum for two shows in September.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NAMM_overview.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1498" title="NAMM_overview" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NAMM_overview-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NAMM_overview-300x198.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NAMM_overview.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>Members of No Doubt, Black Sabbath and The Eagles as well as Stevie Wonder and Brian Wilson recently descended on Anaheim, California for the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM).</p>
<p>This massive trade show features product debuts and demos by makers of guitars, keyboards, drums and other musical instruments including ukuleles and violins, as well as electronics and music gear. It’s appropriate that the show takes place at the Anaheim Convention Center right next door to Disneyland, because NAMM is like Disneyland for countless musicians who spent hours playing their dream instruments and geeking out with fellow gear-heads over the course of the four-day show.</p>
<p>What’s more, several music-related charities were on hand, getting the word out about their important work and encouraging musicians to get involved. At the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares</a> booth in the heart of the trade show, the staff informed musicians about the valuable assistance they provide people in the music community <a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MusiCares.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1499" title="MusiCares" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MusiCares-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>in times of need. MusiCares’ Brett Bryngelson explained that the non-profit is currently working to expand its network of healthcare providers that offer discounted services to musicians.</p>
<p>The Grammy-related charity is also gearing up for a massive tribute to Bruce Springsteen in Los Angeles this week, featuring performances by Neil Young, Mumford and Sons, Patti Smith, Elton John, Tom Morello and more to raise money for emergency financial assistance and addiction recovery programs it offers the music community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hearnet.com/ " target="_blank"> H.E.A.R</a>. was also on hand to educate NAMM-goers about preventing hearing loss and tinnitus among musicians and music fans. The non-profit’s mission is to raise awareness of the dangers of repeated exposure to excessive noise levels from music that can lead to permanent hearing loss and to teach people how to prevent it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/John-Lennon-Bus-e1360181031859.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1500" title="John Lennon Bus" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/John-Lennon-Bus-e1360181031859-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/John-Lennon-Bus-e1360181031859-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/John-Lennon-Bus-e1360181031859-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Meanwhile, right outside, the<a href="http://www.lennonbus.org/" target="_blank"> John Lennon Educational Tour Bus</a> was parked offering tours to kids, musicians, and anyone interested in getting a glimpse of its state-of-the-art recording facilities. This non-profit mobile recording studio offers students the chance to write and record music with top-notch equipment and music professionals at no charge.</p>
<p>“We’re at NAMM to promote our idea and get musicians involved in supporting the bus,” engineer/producer Hans Ages told Music for Good. “It’s a free space where kids can be completely creative. It’s a ripe environment for inspiration!”</p>
<p>These were just a few of the great causes on hand at <a href="http://www.namm.org/" target="_blank">NAMM</a>. Here’s hoping we see even more in the coming years!</p>

<p>Addiction is a very real issue many artists struggle to overcome, and having a strong support network can make the all the difference between recovery and relapse. After committing to sobriety, the late DJ AM dedicated himself to helping others struggling with substance abuse before a tragic plane crash left him with severe physical pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. On May 31, <a href="http://www.grammy.org/musicares">MusiCares</a> will honor his memory during its eighth annual MusiCares MAP Fund benefit concert with a presentation commemorating the official launch of the DJ AM Memorial Fund.</p>
<p>The DJ AM Memorial Fund will help MusiCares provide a safety net of critical assistance for music people in times of need by funding addiction recovery services for its clients, supplementing the organization&#8217;s resources for helping people cope with financial, medical, and personal emergencies related to addiction. Additionally, by honoring the musical legacy of Adam &#8220;DJ AM&#8221; Goldstein in conjunction with his commitment to sobriety, the fund aims to help MusiCares <a href="http://www.grammy.org/news/reducing-the-stigma-of-addiction">clear the stigma</a> associated with addiction and substance abuse.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s concert at Club Nokia in Los Angeles will also honor Alice in Chains co-founder Jerry Cantrell, and Sony/ATV Music Publishing Senior Consultant Neil Lasher for their support of MusiCares and their work to further the mission and goals of the organization. Comedian/stuntman Steve-O, himself a recovered addict, will host the event featuring performances by Alice in Chains, Heart, Billy Idol, Mark Lanegan, Duff McKagen’s Loaded, as well as a DJ set by Moby, and more.</p>
<p>Learn more and support the DJ AM Memorial fund <a href="http://djam.com/donate.html">here</a>. Tickets are also still available for the benefit concert on May 31 &#8212; grab them <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/2C00486CBEDE4D1E?artistid=767861&amp;majorcatid=10005&amp;minorcatid=0">here</a>.</p>
