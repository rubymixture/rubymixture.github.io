<p>Chris Thile, a four-time Grammy-winning artist and member of Punch Brothers and Nickel Creek, gave a rare solo performance on July 5 benefitting FLOW (For Love of Water), a nonprofit organization that works to protect the Great Lakes through use of public trust principles and an underpinning of science and technical analysis.</p>
<p>Guests on the grounds of the newly restored Cherry Basket Farm in Omena, MI were greeted with delicious cocktails and snacks before gathering inside a barn for the concert, which consisted of a broad range of Thile’s original tunes as well as impressive Radiohead and Bach covers interpreted on the mandolin.</p>
<p>Thile, who also hosts NPR’s popular radio show <em>Live From Here</em> (formerly known as <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>), spoke passionately about the importance of organizations like FLOW. &#8220;What organizations like FLOW are doing is considered to be among the most important work that humanity is doing, that we&#8217;re doing it is a testament to the ultimate goodness of humanity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Audience members were united in their love of both the Great Lakes and the music, and felt it was a powerful experience to see so many people coming together in the spirit of a good cause – protecting Michigan&#8217;s water – and watching Thile perform silhouetted against the setting sun with his mandolin.</p>
