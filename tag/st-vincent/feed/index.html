<p><em>By Jay Corliss<br />
</em></p>
<p>Since the tragic school shooting in Parkland, FL last month, students from Parkland School and young people across the country have been advocating for stricter gun control laws and calling for an end to gun violence. Their movement, March For Our Lives, has generated many social media posts, walkouts, and debates about gun laws.</p>
<p>Now it seems that their efforts are inspiring musicians to take a stance on the issue. On March 2, Harry Styles tweeted his support by saying, &#8220;I just signed the @AMarch4OurLives petition, and you should too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The petition precedes the March For Our Lives event on March 24 and outlines the reforms that students will demand from lawmakers as they descend on Washington, DC and various state capitals.</p>
<p>Other musicians who have signed the petition include Hayley Williams from Paramore, St. Vincent, Justin Bieber, and Fifth Harmony&#8217;s Lauren Jauregui.</p>
<p>Recently, Sophie Hawley-Weld from emerging dance-pop duo Sofi Tukker also showed her support for the movement by rocking a March For Our Lives Sticker on her guitar strap during a <em>Conan</em> performance.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrRi1z8_59I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Rock band Incubus are also encouraging fans join the March for Our Lives event, and are offering the chance to win tickets to the upcoming In Bloom Festival in Houston and meet the band <a href="https://www.propeller.la/inbloom">via Propeller</a> by taking action and joining the movement to end gun violence in schools.</p>
<p>“As a band, we are so amazed and in awe of the young humans who have responded to the Parkland School shooting last month in Florida,” Incubus said in a statement. “We support you and we are so grateful for your courage and perseverance in organizing March For Our Lives and rallying the country to help end gun violence.”</p>

<p><em>By Kennedi Johnson</em></p>
<p>Surrealist filmmaker and artist David Lynch has been a practitioner and advocate of Transcendental Meditation (TM) for more than 40 years. “TM is, in a word, life changing for the good,” says Lynch. In order to bring this “life changing” practice to people who experience stress or trauma, Lynch founded the David Lynch Foundation (DLF) in 2005.</p>
<p>In order to raise funds to further DLF&#8217;s work, it will host its first Festival of Disruption October 8-9 at the Ace Hotel and Theatre in downtown LA. The event will feature performances by an impressive array of musicians including St. Vincent, Robert Plant &amp; the Sensational Space Shifters, Rhye and Sky Ferreira. Renowned composer Angelo Badalamenti, who scored Lynch’s famed films <em>Blue Velvet </em>and <em>Mullholland Drive </em>will perform music from the <em>Twin Peaks </em>series.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Festival-of-Disruption.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4501" title="Festival-of-Disruption" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Festival-of-Disruption.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="188" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Festival-of-Disruption.jpg 620w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Festival-of-Disruption-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></a>Lynch hand-selected his favorite artists in various fields and backgrounds to take part in the one-of-a-kind event: musicians, visual artists, virtual reality creators, choreographers, and DJs.</p>
<p>In addition to the musical performances, there will be talks by renowned architect Frank Gehry, actors Laura Dern, Kyle Maclachlan and Mel Brooks, photography exhibits by Lynch and Chris Stein, a virtual reality experience by Chris Milk, a new dance piece choreographed by Ryan Heffington, and DJ sets by the Roots’ Questlove and KCRW’s Jason Bentley.</p>
<p>There will also be screenings of rarely viewed Lynch short films and classics, daily Transcendental Meditation sessions, and more. All of the funds from the Festival of Disruption will directly benefit the David Lynch Foundation.</p>
<p>Lynch initially began the DLF as an effort to fund the teaching of TM in schools. Performed twice a day, Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a practice in which the participant sits with his or her eyes closed and allows themselves to enter a “level of peaceful awareness.” There have been countless testimonials affirming TM’s ability to relieve stress and restore one’s composure.</p>
<p>The Foundation eventually expanded to help “at-risk” populations that experience trauma and toxic stress including African war refugees, prisoners, victims of domestic violence, veterans suffering from PTSD, and underprivileged children in low-income neighborhoods and schools.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>While most people think of NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) as a musician’s playground where gearheads check out the latest instruments and jam out on the $4,000 guitar they’ve been eyeing, many don’t realize that promoting music education is at the forefront of everything NAMM does.</p>
<p>At this year’s <a href="https://www.namm.org/" target="_blank">NAMM trade show</a> at the Anaheim Convention Center January 21-24, everyone from Weird Al Yankovic to Dr. John to St. Vincent did their part to celebrate the importance of music education in schools and inspire younger generations of musicians to play and pursue careers in music.</p>
<p>At the inaugural Rally for Music Education, <a href="https://www.nammfoundation.org/" target="_blank">NAMM Foundation</a> Executive Director Mary Luehrsen interviewed Yankovic. The curly-haired comic-singer discussed his creative process and how music lessons shaped his career. He explained that a traveling salesman came to his parents’ front door when he was young selling musical instruments, and they bought him an accordion rather than a guitar.</p>
<p>“It worked out&#8230;the accordion made me stand out,” he said. “If I’d learned the guitar I would have been one of 10 million people playing guitar and trying to get noticed.”</p>
<p>During the lighthearted exchange, Yankovic gave students in the audience some serious advice. “If you make a living doing something you’re passionate about, you’re already successful,” he said.</p>
<div id="attachment_4125" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/StVincentNAMM.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4125" title="StVincentNAMM" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/StVincentNAMM-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/StVincentNAMM-300x221.jpg 300w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/StVincentNAMM.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">St Vincent at NAMM 2016</p></div>
<p>Renowned indie artist Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent, also spoke to NAMM-goers during an interview with with NAMM President Joe Lamond about the launch of her own signature guitar with Ernie Ball, and her major musical influences including Nirvana and David Bowie.</p>
<p>“I guess I always looked at guitar as a noise-generator,” Clark said. “It could be a monster, it could be a shield, it could be very gentle. So I kind of just tried to explore the full palette of what guitar means and try to reinvent it for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.”</p>
<p>What’s more, the NAMM community took part in a Day of Service at James Guinn Elementary School in Anaheim on January 19 by coaching 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> graders to make music. The kids played guitars, drums and ukuleles with music educators and reps from Kala Brand Music and Remo Inc.</p>
<div id="attachment_4126" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Uke-Class.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4126" title="Uke Class" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Uke-Class-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Uke-Class-300x199.jpg 300w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Uke-Class.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ukulele class during the NAMM Day of Service.

<p>&#8220;The NAMM Foundation works year-long to bring music to children around the world,&#8221; said Lamond. &#8220;And while our members come from around the globe, making a difference right here in Anaheim has special meaning to us. We’re proud to support the passionate music teachers, parents, students and administrators in the Anaheim City School District who are working so hard to ensure every child has an opportunity for a well-rounded education that includes music!”</p>
<p>The John Lennon Educational Tour Bus has become a regular fixture at NAMM and was parked outside the Anaheim Convention Center offering tours to students and NAMM-goers who were treated to a glimpse of its state-of-the art, mobile recording studio. The non-profit offers students the chance to write and record music with high-quality equipment and music professionals completely for free. The Bus celebrated its 19th year at NAMM with a party featuring a Dr. John &amp; The Nite Trippers.</p>
<p>Lastly, renowned rocker Alice Cooper joined Beasto Blanco for the NAMMJAM 2016 at the City National Grove Of Anaheim benefiting the <a href="https://hobmusicforward.org/" target="_blank">House of Blues Music Forward Foundation</a> on January 22. A live silent auction held during the event featured music memorabilia, autographed guitars, musicians’ original artwork and more to further Music Forward’s mission of providing young people with music-industry mentorships and greater access to music education.</p>
