<p>Metallica is launching a national community service initiative dedicated to improving the communities that have been part of their journey for so many years. The band’s All Within My Hands foundation, launched last year, has declared May 23 as Metallica Day of Service, encouraging fans to go out and volunteer with local food banks to help fight nationwide hunger.</p>
<p>Last summer during their tour, the band contributed to local charity partners in each city they performed in including <a href="https://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Kids Rock</a>, <a href="https://www.grammy.com/musicares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusiCares </a>and <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America</a>. Now they’re encouraging people to get involved by volunteering in their communities.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://allwithinmyhands.org/blog/news/452442/join-all-within-my-hands-to-help-out-in-your-commu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of foodbanks here</a> and find one to volunteer with in your area. If those are out of reach, Metallica suggests visiting the <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America website</a> to find a nearby food bank. Volunteers who register to pitch in on Metallica’s Day of Service will be given an All Within My Hands t-shirt.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em></p>
<p>In response to the firestorms that recently devastated the North Bay area in California, several businesses and musicians have banded together to form Band Together Bay Area – a coalition including Kaiser Permanente, Google, the San Francisco Giants, Levi Strauss Foundation, and Live Nation – to support those affected by the deadliest and most destructive firestorm in California history.</p>
<p>In addition to raising more than $6.5 million from corporate sponsors and donors, Band Together Bay area will host a benefit concert on Thursday, November 9 at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, with headliners including Metallica, Dave Matthews, G-Eazy, and more. One hundred percent of the proceeds for this concert will go the Tipping Point Emergency Relief Fund in order to provide housing, food, education, healthcare, and other services to low-income communities devastated by the firestorm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our neighbors in the North Bay have shown incredible strength as a community, and Google is proud to support Band Together Bay Area to help bring critical resources, funding, and support for those affected by the devastating wildfires in Northern California,” said Google VP Jacqueline Fuller.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iI3N6TJuHqw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>“The recent tragic events up in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Counties have left us all saddened,” said Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich in a video promoting the concert.</p>
<p>“We’re here to help as much as we can, and this concert on November 9 is one small way we can do that.”</p>
<p>The firestorm has burned almost 200,000 acres and 6,000 homes in the Bay Area, leaving thousands of residents without homes or shelter. The damage costs have already reached billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Tickets for the concert are available at <a href="https://www.bandtogetherbayarea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bandtogetherbayarea.org</a> and at <a href="https://www1.ticketmaster.com/band-together-bay-area-a-benefit-san-francisco-california-11-09-2017/event/1C005357B6CA4A9D?artistid=735647&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ticketmaster</a>. First responders, volunteers, and families that have been affected the fires will be able to attend the concert free of charge.</p>

<p><em>By Kennedi Johnson</em></p>
<p>Social justice platform Global Citizen will host its fifth annual Global Citizen Festival on September 24 in New York&#8217;s Central Park, featuring an array of top performers including Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Selena Gomez, Major Lazer and Metallica.</p>
<p>Unlike most concerts, tickets are not for sale. Instead, in order to earn passes to the festival, you must <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/festival/2016/education/" target="_blank">take action</a> to bring awareness to global issues including equal access to education and gender equality. These actions include tweeting messages to the UN Secretary General to support education initiatives, Instagramming a photo of yourself with a book that changed your life, and signing petitions. Global Citizen believes an increase in awareness of these issues will lead to an increase global action and leadership.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GCY-crowd.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4562" title="GCY crowd" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GCY-crowd-1024x430.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="181" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GCY-crowd-1024x430.jpg 1024w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GCY-crowd-300x126.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GCY-crowd.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></a>The festival will also feature Chris Martin of Coldplay, Usher, Ellie Golding, Yandel and Cat Stevens. “While much of the world’s great cities are becoming no-go areas and ruins besieged by fear and divisive conflicts, it’s great to see a global counter-movement for peace through rebalancing of wealth beyond politics and towards human equality,” says Stevens.</p>
<p>The Global Citizen Festival will be hosted by top-notch entertainers including Chelsea Handler, Hugh Jackman, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra, Salma Hayek and Seth Meyers. “I am proud and excited to be a part of such an important movement with Global Citizen,” says Handler. “The Festival helps bring serious issues into the broader conversation and encourages people to take action. This year’s focus is women and girls, which is such a prevalent topic in our society, I hope lending my voice and my action to this can help to positively impact those.”</p>
<p>The Festival is partnering with Gucci’s Chime for Change campaign. Cofounded by Beyoncé and Hayek, Chime for Change began in 2013 to fight for and to empower girls and women across the globe. It has funded more than 420 projects across 88 countries to date. “As cofounder of Chime for Change, I’ve been deeply inspired by the girls and women I have met around the world who are determined to get an education and build a better future,” says Hayek. “They are truly the agents of change who can help to bring an end to extreme poverty.”</p>
<p>Also partnering with the Festival for the fifth consecutive year is the mass media company <a href="http://www.iheartmedia.com/Philanthropy/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">iHeartMedia</a>, which will bring its own initiative to the Festival: using music as a tool to fight inequality, protect the Earth, and end extreme poverty by 2030.</p>
<p>Up to 50,000 tickets will be given out to Global Citizens for the Festival. Limited VIP tickets are available for purchase <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/globalcitizen" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you can&#8217;t make it to the festival, you can get in on the action from the comfort of your own couch, because the Global Citizen Festival will be aired live on MSNBC and livestreamed on YouTube.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em><strong></strong></p>
<p>Along with a stellar lineup featuring the likes of Paul McCartney, Metallica, Florence and the Machine, Flying Lotus, Alt-J and A$AP Rocky, Lollapalooza is once again focusing on giving back to the community by running its annual Lolla Cares initiative – a showcase of several fantastic non-profit organizations that the festival supports.</p>
<p>If you’re attending the Grant Park extravaganza taking place July 31-August 2, be sure to stop by some of the booths and check out these great causes. And if you can&#8217;t attend the festival, be sure to visit these organizations&#8217; websites and catch live-streamed performances on<a href="http://www.lollapalooza.com/updates/2015-livestream-schedule/" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://lollapalooza.redbull.tv/" target="_blank">Red Bull TV</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.chicagocares.org/">Chicago Cares</a></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Chicago Cares works to build a stronger community by addressing issues including hunger, education, poverty and job readiness. These services are especially essential in a city that saw 432 murders in 2014, boasting one of the highest murder rates in the country. Founded in 1991 by Leslie Bluhm and Mary Prchal, the organization has amassed 500,000 volunteers, and is one of Chicago’s leading non-profits. Chicago Cares has created tens of thousands of programs to educate and empower volunteers to help shape the future of their community.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.headcount.org/" target="_blank">HeadCount </a></strong></p>
<p>HeadCount returns to Lolla this year to help register voters of all ages. The organization, founded in 2004, is focused on working with musicians and concerts in order to convince the masses to register and vote. HeadCount aims to persuade people to participate in politics, and stresses the importance of voting in order to make a direct impact on the community. The organization has registered more than 300,000 voters since 2004, and travels around the country staging voter registration drives at various music events.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://lovehopestrength.org/" target="_blank">Love Hope Strength Foundation</a> </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3640" title="Green Street" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Green-Street.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Love Hope Strength is a cancer foundation promoting outreach and awareness programs for cancer victims, survivors and their families. In 2007, LHSF hosted the world’s highest concert on land at Mount Everest, gaining an audience of over 3 million through the internet and an MTV documentary. LHSF builds and funds cancer centers around the world, and is supported by several musicians including Wilco, The Doobie Brothers and Jason Mraz.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.meatfreemondays.com/" target="_blank">Meat Free Monday</a> </strong></p>
<p>2015 Lollapalooza headliner Paul McCartney and his daughters Mary &amp; Stella McCartney helped launch Meat Free Monday in 2009, which is a not-for-profit campaign dedicated to raising awareness about the health and environmental impacts of eating meat. The initiative, supported by celebrities such as Gwenyth Paltrow and Ricky Gervais, encourages people to refrain from eating meat at least once a week.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.grammy.org/musicares" target="_blank">MusiCares </a></strong></p>
<p>MusiCares, established by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, provides musicians with financial and medical aid in their times of need, and treats each case with full confidentiality. The foundation offers programs such as emergency financial assistance, senior housing, outreach, and drug rehabilitation.</p>
<p><span id="more-3636"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.one.org/us/" target="_blank">ONE</a> </strong></p>
<p>ONE, co-founded by U2’s Bono, is an advocacy and international campaigning organization fighting to end extreme poverty, hunger, and preventable diseases around the world—namely in Africa, and raises public and political awareness to combat life-threatening issues such as AIDS. The organization has seen a number of successes in its advocacy efforts, and currently 9 million people in Africa today have access to AIDS medication &#8212; up from 50,000 in 2002. In previous years, ONE’s booth at Lollapalooza offered festival-goers the opportunity to write postcards to their representatives, asking them to support and advocate the Electrify Africa Act, which aims to provide electricity to 50 million people in sub-Saharan Arica.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/" target="_blank">Oxfam America</a> </strong></p>
<p>Like ONE, Oxfam America is another organization combatting extreme poverty in developing countries. The Chicago chapter of Oxfam American will represent the organization at Lollapalooza, encouraging fans to fight against global poverty and injustice. The music-savvy charity released a free Summer Jams mixtape (http://www.oxfamamerica.org/take-action/volunteer/concerts-festivals/oxfam-summer-jams-2015/) earlier this year, featuring tracks from Mew, Father John Misty, Ra Ra Riot and more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.peta.org/" target="_blank">PETA</a></strong></p>
<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is arguably the largest animal rights organization in the world, and has amassed more than 3 million members and supporters. The organization has received tons of media attention since its founding in 1980, and is endorsed by countless celebrities. It primarily focuses on protecting animals from factory farms, the clothing trade, laboratories, and harmful entertainment industry practices.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://rockthevote.com/" target="_blank">Rock the Vote</a></strong></p>
<p>Rock the Vote is the largest non-profit organization that specifically aims on encouraging young people to flex their political power and vote. The organization fuses pop culture with politics, making voting more enticing and accessible to younger audiences. Founded in 1990, Rock the Vote has helped encourage youth to create political and social change for 25 years through television campaigns and appearances at pop culture events. Rock the Vote has processed nearly 7 million voter registrations since its inception.</p>
<p><strong>Soberside </strong></p>
<p>Soberside is an initiative comprised of clean and sober music fans who choose to remain sober (alcohol and drug free) at music festivals. The tent will be on-sight at Lolla for any music fans who choose to remain sober during the festivities.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sydrocks.com/" target="_blank">Syd Rocks</a></strong></p>
<p>Syd Rocks is a Chicago-based foundation that raises awareness and funds research for Langerhan’s Cell Histiocytosis, a rare disease of the bone marrow and lymph nodes—primarily affecting children. Syd Rocks will be selling necklaces, t-shirts, hats and bracelets at Lollapalooza to raise funds for its cause.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sydrocks.com/" target="_blank">Working Bikes </a></strong></p>
<p>Working Bikes will be at Lollapalooza for the fourth year in a row. The organization is dedicated to rescuing discarded bikes and redistributing them to impoverished communities.

<p><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p>On April 1, Rhino Records will release <em>Ronnie James Dio: This Is Your Life</em>, a compilation album featuring songs by heavy metal superstar Ronnie James Dio covered by his famous friends and admirers.</p>
<p>The compilation will benefit the <a href="http://diocancerfund.org/" target="_blank">Dio Cancer Fund</a>, which was founded by Dio’s wife, Wendy, and Sandeep Kapoor, M.D after the famed rocker lost his battle with stomach cancer three years ago.</p>
<p>Through the charity, Dio&#8217;s fans came together to ensure his memory would continue to have a positive impact on the world by donating thousands of dollars to cancer research in his name.</p>
<p>Artists on the compilation include Metallica, Scorpions, Anthrax, Halestorm and Tenacious D, who perform Dio&#8217;s famed tracks including &#8220;The Temple of the King,&#8221; &#8220;Neon Knights,&#8221; &#8220;Straight Through The Heart&#8221; and &#8220;The Last In Line.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Dio was the master,&#8221; Jack Black of Tenacious D tells Music for Good. &#8220;He was the Pavarotti of heavy metal vocalists. [He had] soaring melodies and a lion&#8217;s roar to match. He was also one of the coolest guys I&#8217;ve ever had the honor of meeting. No one could touch his brilliance&#8230;on or off the stage.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s hard not to pick a great Dio track…but this one appealed to us,&#8221; says Kyle Gass of &#8220;The Last In Line,&#8221; the track that he and Black chose for Tenacious D to record. &#8220;Recording the track was a blast. Our electric guitarist, John Konesky, shredded a solo. I said, ‘That’s pretty good, but let’s try out my recorder.’ Lo and behold it shredded even more and added a unique element to the track.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gass added that Dio had a tremendous impact on his band, and that the cameo the legendary rocker made in Tenacious D&#8217;s musical comedy film<em> The Pick of Destiny</em> was a dream come true for the band. &#8220;Dio obviously has been a major influence and inspiration for the D,&#8221; Gass says. &#8220;His performance in <em>The Pick of Destiny</em> was a magical moment for us, and we’ll always miss him. Rock on, Dio.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dio Cancer Fund held the first listening party for the album on March 14 at the South by Southwest music festival. The event, which took place at the Bayou in Austin, featured a Dio trivia game in which attendees could win prizes while they listened to the tribute album for the first time. Fans reportedly had tears in their eyes after “This Is Your Life,” the closing track.</p>

<p>The Fund also recently held its third annual Awards Gala on March 17 at the Avalon in Hollywood, where awards were presented to thank those who have played a significant role in spreading awareness of the Fund’s important work. Honorees included Judas Priest’s Rob Halford and Rhino Entertainment’s Kevin Gore.</p>
<p>The next listening party will take place during the Monsters of Rock cruise, which sets sail from Florida March 28.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://diocancerfund.org/" target="_blank">Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund</a> is a 501C3 charity dedicated to cancer prevention, research and education that has already raised more than $700,000. The funds will all go toward the cancer research work of the T. J. Martell Foundation for Cancer, AIDS and Leukemia Research and the gastric cancer research unit of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, where Ronnie was treated during the last six months of his life.</p>
