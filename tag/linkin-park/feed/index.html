<p><em>By Rachel Komich</em></p>
<p>Linkin Park is hosting a night of music in honor of their late bandmate Chester Bennington on October 27 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. For one night only, Linkin Park will be joined by artists including Blink-182, Machine Gun Kelly, Jonathan Davis from Korn, Kiiara, Zedd, members of No Doubt, System of A Down, Yellowcard, Avenged Sevenfold and many others.</p>
<p>The concert, Linkin Park &amp; Friends Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington, sold out immediately but the entire show will be live streaming for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/linkinpark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkin Park’s Youtube channel</a> beginning at 7:45pm PST on October 27.</p>
<p>The night will be the first time that Linkin Park will be performing on stage together since Bennington passed away on July 20, so it is bound to be a moving and emotional evening.</p>
<p>Linkin Park established the One More Light Fund in honor of their friend and bandmate’s enthusiasm to give back to others. The fund is part of the non-profit Music for Relief, which was co-founded by Bennington and his bandmates to provide aid to natural disaster survivors and to protect the environment. Follow the link to support The One More Light Fund <a href="https://musicforrelief.z2systems.com/np/clients/musicforrelief/donation.jsp?campaign=1&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>By James Pleasant</em></p>
<p>Influential power-pop band Weezer will headline the second annual Rhonda’s Kiss benefit concert on November 3 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles to help cancer patients in need.</p>
<p>Actor Johnny Depp, who lost his mother to cancer earlier this year, will be presented with the inaugural Healing &amp; Hope Award at the event for his charitable donations and work to help cancer patients and survivors over the years.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the benefit show will be donated to the <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Programs-and-Services/Cancer-Institute/" target="_blank">Cedars-Sinai Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute</a>, the leading medical center for cancer care in Los Angeles.</p>
<div id="attachment_4702" style="width: 221px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JohnnyDepp.png"><img class=" wp-image-4702   " title="JohnnyDepp" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JohnnyDepp-300x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="211" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JohnnyDepp-300x300.png 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JohnnyDepp-150x150.png 150w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JohnnyDepp.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Johnny Depp</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Cancer affects many lives and this year it was my family&#8217;s turn,&#8221; said Depp in a statement. &#8220;The team at Cedars-Sinai works tirelessly to help people in their darkest moments. Their work is invaluable to all of us, and I will support any opportunity to help shine a light on the cause through Rhonda&#8217;s Kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sugar Ray’s Mark McGrath will serve as the emcee for this year’s benefit show. What’s more, his supergroup The Hellcat Saints, featuring members of Linkin Park, Weezer, Queens of the Stone Age, Jane’s Addiction and more, will open the show.</p>
<p>Rhonda’s Kiss has donated more than $750,000 to hospitals in the United States to benefit individuals and patients suffering from cancer. It was established in 2014 after Rhonda Stefanski, the late wife of the organization’s executive director, was diagnosed with stage-4 pancreatic cancer. One of her last wishes before her death was to create an event dedicated to helping cancer patients in inner-cities and urban communities pay for treatment. The organization raised $500,000 at the inaugural benefit concert in 2015.</p>

<p>In August, southern Louisiana suffered continuous rainfall that resulted in historic, disastrous flooding that submerged thousands of homes and businesses. The flooding was so drastic that it has been declared the largest natural disaster in the United States since Hurricane Sandy of 2012.</p>
<p>The flood’s impact was far reaching with 20 of Louisiana’s parishes receiving more than <em>7 trillion gallons </em>of rainwater in just two days. “Thousands of people in Louisiana have lost everything they own and need our help now,&#8221; Brad Kieserman, Red Cross&#8217; vice president of disaster services operations, told <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/18/us/louisiana-flooding/" target="_blank">CNN</a>. In order to help those in need, the non-profit organization Music for Relief is teaming up with various artists and other activists to launch the #LousianaStrong campaign.</p>
<div id="attachment_4683" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LinkinPark.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-4683" title="LinkinPark" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LinkinPark-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="240" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LinkinPark-290x300.jpg 290w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LinkinPark.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Linkin Park</p></div>
<p>Music for Relief was founded by the band Linkin Park and is dedicated to preserving the environment and helping those affected by natural disasters. Music for Relief saw the need caused by the massive flooding and began the #LouisianaStrong campaign, which aims to raise awareness about the severity of the situation in Louisiana and raise money for the victims of the natural disaster, and partnered with Propeller, an online community that encourages its members to engage in socially conscious actions to better society.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1T0DtSehvAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Those who support and engage in socially meaningful causes are rewarded through a point-based system. The more you support causes, the more points you earn; the more points you earn, the more stuff you get. By donating to Music for Relief’s disaster relief fund, you can earn tickets to live performances by Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Roger Waters and more at the Desert Trip Music Festival, or attend a live recording of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in October. You could also win a VIP experience with Blink-182 in Irvine, California or with the Chainsmokers at the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, anyone who donates will receive an 18-track compilation dedicated to the #LouisianaStrong campaign, including tracks by artists including Gramatik, The Glitch Mob’s Boreta, Shana Halligan, and <em>the Voice</em> finalist Whitney Myer.</p>

<p>The renowned rap metal band will continue their tradition of generously giving one dollar per concert ticket sold to their charity, <a href="http://musicforrelief.org/" target="_blank">Music for Relief</a>, during their Carnivores Tour this summer with Thirty Seconds to Mars and AFI.</p>
<p>Linkin Park founded Music for Relief in 2005 after the Indian Ocean Tsunami hit. Since then, the charity has raised more than $6 million for countries facing disasters across multiple continents. It also aims to bring musicians and fans together to raise funds and donate supplies for disaster relief.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_2294" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Linkin-Park1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2294" title="Linkin Park1" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Linkin-Park1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Linkin-Park1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Linkin-Park1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Linkin Park</p></div>
<p>Music for Relief, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Grammy Award-winning band Linkin Park have joined forces to raise funds to equip a Nepalese village with safe, green bio-gas technology. Why is this important? Because hundreds of poor families in the Terai region of Nepal currently rely on thousands of pounds of wood to do their cooking, which results in thousands of trees being cut down and the destruction of local wildlife&#8217;s natural habitat. This outdated method of cooking also causes women and children to become sick or to die prematurely from smoke inhalation from the wood-burning stoves. By switching to bio-gas, it would go a long way to prevent this and offer a sustainable energy solution.</p>
<p>California rockers Linkin Park founded the non-profit org <a href="http://www.musicforrelief.org" target="_blank">Music for Relief</a> to aid survivors of natural disasters and raise funds for the prevention of future disasters. Supporters who raise $565 (the cost of one bio-gas system and toilet) for the <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/cleancookstoveskumrose/fundraiser/musicforrelief1" target="_blank">Cookstoves for Kumrose</a> campaign will be eligible to win the chance to see Linkin Park perform live in an intimate venue in Las Vegas.</p>
<div id="attachment_2295" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nepal-biogas.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2295" title="Nepal-biogas" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nepal-biogas-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nepal-biogas-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nepal-biogas.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nepalese woman using a sustainable bio-gas stove</p></div>
<p>The “clean cookstove” campaign riffs off the success of previous campaigns with <a href="http://powertheworld.org" target="_blank">Power the World</a>, an organization that supports the UN Secretary-General to bring sustainable energy solutions to 1 million people throughout the world.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting to find a solution that helps on multiple levels,” said Dave ‘Phoenix’ Farrell of Linkin Park. “ The clean, bio-gas cookstoves WWF is implementing will improve families’ health, keep women and children safer and protect the environment. We hope our supporters will join us in providing technology for those living in the Kumrose village in Nepal.”</p>
<p>The beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terai_Arc_Landscape" target="_blank">Terai Arc Landscape</a> of Nepal is home to a diverse range of ecosystems that support endangered animals including the rare Bengal tiger and 7 million Nepali people. Its inhabitants are among the poorest in the world, with half of the population living below the poverty line. Due to these impoverished conditions and the cost of electricity, the population relies on using wood for cooking—resulting in clear cutting of tress with devastating consequences for both people and wildlife.</p>
<p>Bio-gas offers a clean and cost-effective solution to this problem. It works by processing human and animal waste to produce methane that burns with a light blue flame for cooking – thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation in the region.</p>
<p>“We hope people are inspired to join this campaign to uplift an entire village by providing cleaner air, better healthcare, increased incomes for locals, while at the same time regenerating forest habitat for tigers, rhinos, and the many other species that live there,” added Shubash Lohani, Deputy Director of WWF’s Eastern Himalayas Program.</p>

<p><em>By Sarah Weiss</em></p>
<p><em></em>Music for Relief, a non-profit founded by rock band Linkin Park to aid victims of natural disasters and help prevent those disasters, has teamed up with <a href="http://hands.org/projects/projectmoore/" target="_blank">All Hands Volunteers</a> to devise a win-win campaign for music fans and Oklahoma families alike.</p>
<p>By making a $10 donation through <a href="http://www.omaze.com/charities/music-for-relief-2" target="_blank">Omaze</a>, contestants will be entered in a raffle to meet Juanes backstage in NYC, attend Crystal Method’s album release party in LA, or hang out with Linkin Park in their LA recording studio. The prizes also include a flight and a stay for up to two people at a 4-star hotel.</p>
<p>Contestants are encouraged to enter numerous times to increase their chances of winning, with each dollar going to support families in Oklahoma affected by the tornado. Recovery projects will include the rebuilding of homes and schools, and psychosocial support.</p>
<p>Music for Relief also encourages people to donate clothes and other goods to help <a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Mfr_logo_small.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1903" title="Mfr_logo_small" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Mfr_logo_small.jpeg" alt="" width="195" height="223" /></a>families who lost their homes. A series of tornadoes struck central Oklahoma in May, destroying communities, killing dozens of people and injuring others.</p>
<p>Music for Relief was established by Linkin Park in 2005 to provide aid for those affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami. Continuing and expanding on those efforts, Music for Relief has since donated more than $5,000,000 to victims of natural disasters.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>Following on the heels of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the first-ever Giving Tuesday took place last Tuesday (Nov. 27), reminding people that the holidays are more than just a shopping frenzy.</p>
<p>The day was a great success and saw a 53% increase in charitable giving over the same day last year, spurring approximately $10 million in online donations to charities and foundations, according to the <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/" target="_blank">UN Foundation</a>, which created the idea for Giving Tuesday along with <a href="http://www.92y.org/" target="_blank">92Y</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/" target="_blank">Mashable</a>.</p>
<p>A handful of musicians got into the giving spirit, staging performances, donating to charity and encouraging people to get involved in supporting numerous good causes.</p>
<p>Sharkira tweeted “I&#8217;m supporting <a href="http://twitter.com/UNICEF" target="_blank">@UNICEF</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23GivingTuesday" target="_blank">#GivingTuesday</a>”, and John Legend performed at a free concert in New York’s Bryant Park sponsored by JC Penney. The concert not only celebrated Giving Tuesday, but also launched JC Penney’s nationwide Holiday Giving Tour, which will hit 12 cities around the U.S. and feature musical performances, tree-lighting ceremonies, Santa visits and more.</p>
<p>Linkin Park worked with renowned non-profit <a href="http://www.musicforrelief.org/" target="_blank">Music for Relief </a>to spread the word about its <a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/GivingTuesdayLogo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1289" title="GivingTuesdayLogo" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/GivingTuesdayLogo-300x156.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/GivingTuesdayLogo-300x156.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/GivingTuesdayLogo.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Power the World initiative. Designed to provide clean energy solutions for people who don’t have access to electricity, Power the World was established by Linkin Park to support the United Nations’ work to combat poverty and bring solar power to homes and health clinics in Haiti and Uganda.</p>
<p>“The Voice” star Cee Lo Green also got into the act, helping to promote Celebrity Bookends – a set of hand-shaped bookends that’s traveling the world to help raise money for Giving Tuesday partner <a href="http://www.coeduc.org/ " target="_blank">Cooperative for Education</a>, which provides education programs for children in Guatemala.</p>
<p>That said, a relatively small number of musicians publically supported Giving Tuesday, as opposed to World AIDS Day on Saturday (December 1), which saw numerous high-profile musicians like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wudQCJh8wio" target="_blank">Janet Jackson </a>and Alicia Keys actively campaigning to raise awareness and encourage giving.</p>
<p>Imagine the giving power that could be generated if musicians got involved and helped spread the message of Giving Tuesday. Things got off to a great start this year, but here’s hoping next year’s second-annual Giving Tuesday &#8212; set for Dec. 3, 2013 &#8212; will generate even more noise!</p>
