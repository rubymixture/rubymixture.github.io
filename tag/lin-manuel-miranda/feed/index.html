<p><em>By Jay Corliss </em></p>
<p>Since the world learned about thousands of immigrant children being separated from their parents at the US border as part of the new “zero tolerance” immigration policy, many people have been using their platforms to protest the executive order and advocate for the reunification of families who have been separated.</p>
<p>The music community has become particularly passionate about this issue as several musicians and record labels have expressed their outrage at the situation and mobilized their fanbases to take action. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bruce-springsteen-blasts-trumps-inhumane-border-policy/?mbid=social_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Springsteen even diverted from his usual setlist </a>to play “The Ghost of Tom Joad,&#8221; a song about giving a voice to the disenfranchised, and called out the &#8220;inhumane&#8221; policy.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ohboyrecords/status/1009538164573245442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh Boy Records</a> and Third Man Records encouraged their customers to donate to the cause through social media campaigns and by offering in-store incentives.</p>
<p>Also Common, Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES and others have posted links to show fans what actions they can take to support the families impacted by the immigration policy.</p>
<p>“The criminalization and separation of families immigrating to America is inhumane, cruel, and unacceptable,” Common said. “They should be embraced with compassion and love instead of hate and brutality.”</p>
<p>Mayberry encouraged her fans to donate to organizations working to keep families together.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Link to securely donate to a number of organisations working to help children and families being separated and detained by ICE : <a href="https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw">https://t.co/9rKDaxD9rw</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the US on June 30 in “Families Belong Together” marches to protest the policy. Lin Manuel-Miranda, creator of the “Hamilton” hit musical, spoke and sang a lullaby he dedicated to parents who were not able to sing to their children.</p>

<p>Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys attended the rally with her young son Egypt and quoted from a letter written by a woman whose child had been taken away from her at the border. &#8220;If it can happen to any child, it can happen to my child, and your child, and all of our children,&#8221; Keys said.</p>
<p>Despite feeling &#8220;hopeless,&#8221; Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff shared a link to the ActBlue fundraiser site where people can contribute to nonprofit groups working to protect kids separated from their families by ICE.</p>

<p><em>By Kennedi Johnson</em></p>
<p>Although acts of kindness didn’t always make headlines in 2016, the Celebs Gone Good list reminds us that many artists devoted a large portion of their time to raising funds and awareness for people in need. Online social justice campaign platform, <em>DoSomething.org</em>, ranked celebrities who have used their public platform to affect positive in its annual Celebs Gone Good list.</p>
<p>Several renowned musicians made the list, with Beyonce claiming the top spot for her work on gender equity issues, supporting black women in popular culture, raising money for those affected by the Flint Water Crisis, and for organizing a benefit concert to support the Robin Hood Foundation, a non-profit that fights poverty in New York City.</p>
<p><em>Hamilton </em>writer, composer, and star Lin-Manuel Miranda ranked second on the list for his participation in the “Love Make the World Go Round” musical tribute for the victims and families of the 2016 Pulse shooting in Orlando, Florida. Moreover, Miranda has also helped secure funds for Planned Parenthood.</p>
<div id="attachment_4852" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Demi.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4852" title="Demi" src="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Demi-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Demi-225x300.jpg 225w, http://musicforgood.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Demi.jpg 435w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Demi Lovato</p></div>
<p>Chance the Rapper also made the list for his work urging fans to register to vote, and for donating to the homeless population of Chicago, as did Demi Lovato for using her public platform to talk openly about mental illness and for raising awareness of sexual assault and bullying issues.</p>
<p>Other important causes the celebrities on the Celebs Gone Good list supported include HIV/AIDS awareness, protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, early childhood education programs, increased support of marginalized people, and flood relief efforts in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Here’s a complete list of celebrities who landed on the Celebs Gone Good list:</p>
<p>1. Beyoncé, 2. Lin-Manuel Miranda, 3. Taylor Swift, 4. Demi Lovato, 5. Shailene Woodley, 6. John Cena, 7. Miley Cyrus, 8. Lady Gaga, 9. Zendaya, 10. Jesse Williams, 11. Gina Rodriguez, 12.
