<p><em>by Rachel Komich</em></p>
<p>Jack Johnson will headline the Kōkua for Kaua’i benefit concert on May 12 to help restore the community of Kaua’i after unprecedented rains caused widespread devastation on the Hawaiian island, leaving thousands of residents in need of support to rebuild their homes, businesses and farms.</p>
<p>The concert, which will also feature Donavon Frankenreiter, Paula Fuga, and Makana, will take place at the Poipu Beach Athletic Club in Kauai and directly benefit the displaced residents.</p>
<p>All of the proceeds will go to the Kauai Relief &amp; Recovery Fund at Hawai’i Community Foundation (HFC), a fund created to provide immediate relief such as shelter, healthcare, and food and water. HFC is the leading philanthropic institution in Hawaii and distributed more than $59 million in grants and contracts in 2017 alone.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting thousands of locals, the benefit show will be entirely plastic free. There will be no single-use plastic items available for purchase. Instead, beverages will be sold in cans, and all silverware will be compostable. Concert-goers are encouraged to bring their own reusable bottles to refill at water stations, part of the Zero Waste Kauai initiative.</p>

<p>Johnson, who grew up in Hawaii and is an avid supporter of several environmental causes, founded the Kokua Hawaii Foundation with his wife Kim. The foundation supports environmental education for children in Hawaiian schools and teaches them about good health &amp; nutrition in addition to environmental stewardship. Through his tours, albums and personal donations, he has given more than $30 million to charity since 2001.</p>

<p>Metallica is launching a national community service initiative dedicated to improving the communities that have been part of their journey for so many years. The band’s All Within My Hands foundation, launched last year, has declared May 23 as Metallica Day of Service, encouraging fans to go out and volunteer with local food banks to help fight nationwide hunger.</p>
<p>Last summer during their tour, the band contributed to local charity partners in each city they performed in including <a href="https://www.littlekidsrock.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Kids Rock</a>, <a href="https://www.grammy.com/musicares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusiCares </a>and <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America</a>. Now they’re encouraging people to get involved by volunteering in their communities.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://allwithinmyhands.org/blog/news/452442/join-all-within-my-hands-to-help-out-in-your-commu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of foodbanks here</a> and find one to volunteer with in your area. If those are out of reach, Metallica suggests visiting the <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding America website</a> to find a nearby food bank. Volunteers who register to pitch in on Metallica’s Day of Service will be given an All Within My Hands t-shirt.</p>

<p>Our country has managed to progress in a number of civil and human rights issues, however, there is still plenty of work to be done in the protection of marginalized citizens. Whether it&#8217;s protecting the rights of women, the homeless, indigenous people, immigrants, or people of color, there are numerous organizations working to ensure that all are treated fairly and equally.</p>
<p>Although there are activists and organizers who make it their life’s work to fight injustice and inequality, there are still marginalized groups of people in need. As a result, indie-pop twin sister duo Tegan and Sara have launched a foundation aimed to fight for the rights of LGBTQ girls and women.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://teganandsara.com/tegan-and-sara-foundation/" target="_blank">Tegan and Sara Foundation</a> came into existence on Monday December 19<sup>, </sup>when the Quin sisters made an announcement on their website. They were on tour for their most recent album, <em>Love You to Death</em>, when they were inspired to begin an organization to fight for the economic, health and welfare of LGBTQ girls and women. During the tour, the sisters spent time reading fan letters and talking with them in person, meeting with researchers and nonprofits, and holding discussions with LGBTQ rights activists and legislators.</p>
<p>Their experience with people who were knowledgeable about LGBTQ issues left them with a new understanding of the issues this community faces every day. “We learned that the lack of federal funding for LGBTQ services, limited training for doctors about the needs of their LGBTQ patients, and severe workplace discrimination are disproportionately affecting women,” wrote Tegan and Sara in an open letter to fans.</p>
<p>“Most importantly, we learned that LGBTQ women and girls are feeling overwhelmingly rejected and left behind.” In addition to facing discrimination and inadequate healthcare, they also found that LGBTQ women are more likely to face poverty, while LGBTQ women of color and transgender women are more likely to come up against higher levels of discrimination due to racism and transphobia.</p>
<p>Tegan and Sara felt especially compelled to launch this foundation in the midst of an incoming administration that has promised to repress the rights of the LGBTQ community.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p><em></em>Mike Einziger of Incubus, Travis Barker of Blink 182, Pharrell Williams and renowned composer Hans Zimmer may seem like an unlikely group of musicians to work together, but they&#8217;ve teamed up to record a song to bring attention to the plight of child laborers, and to put an end to it.</p>
<p>The formidable crew joined child trafficking survivor Minh Dang to record the song, &#8220;Til Everyone Can See.&#8221; The idea for the song came after they met with the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO), an arm of the United Nations that promotes workers&#8217; rights and calls on governments to institute laws preventing children from being exploited and entering into the labor force.</p>
<p>They released the song and its accompanying video on June 12 to commemorate World Day Against Child Labor. &#8220;Open up your eyes/listen to the cries/it&#8217;s time to right wrong,&#8221; says the song, which was co-written by Einziger and violinist Ann Marie Simpson, and has a distinct &#8220;We Are The World&#8221; vibe to it.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/qHNgfStLwNc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/qHNgfStLwNc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>“There are 168 million children between the ages of five and 18 years in child labor around the world, doing work they are too young to perform,&#8221; Einziger says. “Many are denied the opportunity to go to school. Eighty five million of them are doing work that puts their health or safety, sometimes even their lives, in danger. They’re victims of exploitation in the drugs or sex trade, are recruited as soldiers or made to beg, to work in mines and sweatshops or as domestic workers. This is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other musicians around the world are also pitching in to raise awareness of the plight of child workers through the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/MusicInitiative/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">Global Music against Child Labour Initiative</a>, with orchestras and musicians of all genres dedicating concerts to the struggle against child labor.</p>

<p>While most of Austin was still asleep or nursing their hangovers, a few dozen of us gathered in the Austin Convention Center on the last day of the South by Southwest music festival to discuss how brands and musical artists can effectively work together to create mutually beneficial campaigns, and the role brands can play in being musical trailblazers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to work with bands that are just bubbling up,&#8221; said Miller about his work with sports apparel brand Under Armour. A former artist manager, Miller is relatively new to his role with the company, which involves strategically integrating music into the brand&#8217;s advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford has worked with everyone from country superstar Toby Keith to burgeoning indie bands including Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and The Lumineers, and proudly pointed to the success of its &#8220;Rider Challenge&#8221; series.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Ford-Rider-Challenge.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2600" title="Ford Rider Challenge" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Ford-Rider-Challenge.jpeg" alt="" width="276" height="183" /></a>The web series aired on Live Nation&#8217;s website and featured teams driving around different cities in Ford Fiestas to fill the bands&#8217; tour rider requests, which ranged from blue M&amp;M&#8217;s to Turkish towels. The winning team drove home two Ford Fiestas, and received unlimited passes to attend Live Nation concerts for a year.</p>
<p>Doyle said that the campaign was a great way to attract the attention of Millennials, and received a huge amount of media coverage in outlets ranging from <em>Variety</em> to <em>Billboard</em>. &#8220;It got a lot of great PR,&#8221; she said of the series, which aired during the fourth quarter of 2013. &#8220;The brands pushed it and so did the bands,&#8221; she added, pointing out that Ford has such a big reach that the artists get great exposure from these partnerships as well as the brand.</p>
<p>Doyle also said that Ford recently teamed up with indie record label IAMSOUND and Pitchfork TV to present a series of invitation-only concerts in Los Angeles with up-and-coming artists on IAMSOUND&#8217;s label, including Guards and MS MR. &#8220;It needs to be something more than pasting your logo all over the place,&#8221; she said of the partnerships. &#8220;Brands need to move at the speed of culture or ahead of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Corona teamed up with the hugely popular Latin rock band Mana to tap into the Latin market. The beer purveyors launched &#8220;Mana Como Nunca&#8221; (Mana Like Never Before), which featured rising Latin artists &#8220;refreshing&#8221; classic Mana songs and putting their own spin on the band&#8217;s hits. Corona customers received exclusive, free access to the tracks online and were entered into a sweepstakes for a VIP concert experience with Mana in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>While each brand has its own distinctive ways of reaching customers through music, there&#8217;s one thing they all agreed upon – each of the brands uses music to connect to people&#8217;s emotions. The one thing that&#8217;s undeniable, Miller said, is that &#8220;music connects with everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>By Sarah Weiss</em></p>
<p>No one is immune to catching holiday some holiday cheer &#8212; just ask Jonathan Wilson and Mike Campbell. Together the two musicians will host the second annual Merry Minstrel Musical Circus, A Holiday Gathering and Goodwill Jamathon at the Troubadour on December 20 and 21. Special guests will be announced over the next few weeks, but fans will be sure to witness two nights of musical camaraderie. All of the proceeds from the concert will go benefit <a href="http://www.mahs.org" target="_blank">Manual Arts High School</a> and <a href="http://www.tazzyfund.com" target="_blank">Tazzy Animal Rescue Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Jonathan Wilson, who released his second album, &#8220;Fanfare,&#8221; in October on Downtown records, is partnering again with Mike Campbell (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) to bring this charitable concert to fruition. Last year’s concert included artists such as Jackson Browne, Bob Weir, Jeff Lynne, and Benmont Tench, among others.</p>
<p>“The room was packed wall-to-wall,” declared <em>Rolling Stone</em> about last year’s event. “Campbell&#8230;and Wilson traded jagged, searing guitar lines. Weir stretched out for several minutes of improv with the band and also led the Dead&#8217;s &#8216;West L.A. Fadeaway&#8217; and &#8216;Truckin’,&#8217; with four guitars onstage in epic twang.”</p>
<p>Donations to Manual Arts High school will be used to provide new brass and woodwind instruments to support their burgeoning band program.</p>
<p>The concert will also benefit Tazzy Animal Fund, an animal rescue that focuses on senior and medically challenged dogs.</p>
<p>Tickets for the event are available <a href="http://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/421095" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the country in Washington D.C., the <a href=" http://www.930.com" target="_blank">9:30 Club</a> is raffling off a music lover&#8217;s dream &#8212; two tickets to every 9:30 Club show in 2014.</p>
<p>Going strong after 12 years in a row, the renowned concert venue will give a raffle ticket to anyone who donates new or clean previously owned clothes, a canned food item, or contributes $5 to help local charities that feed the hungry and the homeless.</p>
<p>Donation collections will begin at the 9:30 Club on December 1 and will last until December 31. A maximum of 10 raffle tickets will be distributed to each person per night.</p>
<p>This year’s charities include the DC Central Kitchen, Sasha Bruce House, Capital Area Food Bank, House of Ruth, So Others Might Eat and Bread for the City.</p>
<p>The winner will be selected at the New Year’s Eve show featuring Trombone Shorty &amp; Orleans Avenue with Trouble Funk.</p>
<p>Last year’s winner, Clare Erslev, attended more than 70 shows last year and saw bands such as The Presidents, Reel Big Fish, The Dismemberment Plan, Coheed and Cambria, and GWAR.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve participated for the last four years by donating clothes mostly,&#8221; Erslev said.  &#8220;I would hold onto clothes all year, then parse them out into bags, and would bring the bags to the club most everyday after work during the month of December until I ran out.”</p>
<p>Additional drawings for smaller prizes will also be held throughout the month. The more you donate, the more you can win!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Beyonce.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-865" title="Beyonce" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Beyonce-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Beyonce-300x202.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Beyonce.jpg 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><em>By Hilary Gridley</em></p>
<p>Most of us will never have the chance to join Beyoncé on stage. Fortunately, there&#8217;s an even better way to stand up with the pop star and turn one day into a global day of action for humanitarian efforts as part of her “I Was Here” campaign.</p>
<p>Beyoncé is joining the United Nations and humanitarian aid organizations around the world to bring a billion people a message of hope on World Humanitarian Day. You can add your voice <a href="http://www.whd-iwashere.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and your message will be stored until August 19, when they will all be released together with a special music video for Beyoncé&#8217;s song &#8220;I Was Here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to sending a message, Beyoncé is asking volunteers to do one good deed for another person&#8211;whether it&#8217;s making a sandwich for a homeless person, standing up for someone being picked on, donating old clothing, or mowing a neighbor&#8217;s yard. It may be one small thing, but together with hundreds of thousands of other concerned individuals, these actions can add up into something massive and meaningful.</p>
<p>World Humanitarian Day commemorates the August 19, 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed 22 people. The day recognizes those who face danger and adversity to help others.</p>
<p>Beyoncé&#8217;s “I Was Here” campaign works with a number of humanitarian organizations, including <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/emergencies/" target="_blank">United Nations Population Fund</a>, <a href="http://www.actionaid.org/what-we-do/emergencies-conflict/our-approach" target="_blank">Action Aid</a>, <a href="http://www.care-international.org/" target="_blank">Care International</a>, <a href="http://www.rescue.org/wakeup/pledge" target="_blank">International Rescue Committee</a>, and <a href="http://quiz.wfp.org/" target="_blank">World Food Programme</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all see the headlines and think, &#8216;What can I really do to help?’&#8221; Beyoncé noted. &#8220;World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity for all of us to work together to make a difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>Getting young adults excited about voting, like getting them excited about anything, is much easier when music&#8217;s involved. HeadCount, a nonpartisan grassroots organization that uses the power of music to register voters and raise political consciousness, knew this when they launched the HeadCount Participation Party in 2004.</p>
<p>The HeadCount Participation Party has registered more than 200,000 voters to date, but it takes more than a voter card to get people out of the house on election day. That&#8217;s why they took to the road three election seasons ago with a tour designed to get people excited about casting their vote. This year&#8217;s tour will make four stops along the East Coast leading up to the U.S. presidential election in November, and will be headlined by two artists who took very different paths to eventually call the same city – New Orleans – home: Anders Osborne and Dumpstaphunk.</p>
<p>Osborne is a Swedish guitarist and songwriter who traveled nearly every continent before settling down in New Orleans. His music blurs the line between blues and country, and he has just released a new album called &#8220;Black Eye Galaxy&#8221; about his life as “traveler, musician, an immigrant, a recovering addict, and as a husband and father.”</p>
<p>Dumpstaphunk, on the other hand, draw their inspiration from ‘70s inner-city funk. They have been called &#8220;the best funk band from New Orleans right now&#8221; by the <em>New York Times</em> and will undoubtedly have the entire crowd dancing for democracy by the end of the night.</p>
<p>The tour will also include surprise guests as it hits Baltimore (11/2), Philadelphia (11/3), Washington (11/4), and New York (11/5). Tickets are now available <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/snl/Search.action?query=headcount">here</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about HeadCount, whose board members include Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead and Marc Brownstein of Disco Biscuits, visit its <a href="http://www.headcount.org/">website</a>. You can also <a href="http://headcount.org/events/">find out about volunteering</a> at one of the 1,000 concerts they support every year, including The Shins and Wilco.</p>

<p>Plenty of big-name musicians tackle large issues that loom over countries and span continents, but it&#8217;s surprisingly rare to find some that give something back to a small community that supported their rise to fame. Enter <a href="http://edwardsharpeandthemagneticzeros.com/" target="_blank">Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros</a>, whose most recent album, “Here,” debuted at #5 on the Billboard charts to much acclaim.</p>
<p>The band recorded “Here,” which Relix Magazine called &#8220;an album full of undeniable folk-rock hooks, gospel overtones, infectious lyrics, orchestral swells and a whole lot of love,&#8221; in Ojai, California, 80 miles northwest of Los Angeles. It may seem strange to make a big deal of the recording location, but anyone familiar with Ojai will recognize the city&#8217;s folksy spirituality that permeates the album.</p>
<p>The band certainly recognizes Ojai&#8217;s impact on their work. On September 6, they will honor that impact with a special concert at Libbey Bowl to benefit the <a href="http://www.ovcns.org/" target="_blank">Ojai Valley Community Nursery School</a> (OVCNS), the only parent-owned and operated cooperative nursery school in the Ojai Valley. Through a combination of certified teachers and parent volunteers, OVCNS nurtures children toward a love of learning and respect to others and the Earth.</p>
<p>Edward Sharpe frontman Alex Ebert noted, &#8220;We are really excited to play in Ojai, a place that hosted the making of our last album. What a wonderful thing to be able to give back to this special community with this benefit concert.&#8221;</p>
<p>The band will be in demand come September after returning from back-to-back nearly sold-out tours in the U.S. and Europe. Tickets are now available for the OVCNS show <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=4734295" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t make it? You can get involved with Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros in an entirely different way by creating a music video from any song on their album, “Here.” Submit your video <a href="http://genero.tv/edwardsharpe/" target="_blank">here</a> by August 31 and you could win up to $5000.</p>
