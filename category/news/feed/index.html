<p><em>By Jay Corliss</em></p>
<p>After learning about the worst flood to hit Japan since 1982, Yoshiki of the popular Japanese band X Japan made a donation of 10 million yen (approximately $88,455) to the Japanese Red Cross Society through his own 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization Yoshiki Foundation America.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just saw the news in the U.S., and I pray for those who passed away. I truly hope the damage caused by heavy rain will not spread any more,&#8221; the international superstar shared on social media.</p>
<p>The flood and subsequent landslides and heatwave in southwestern Japan have caused significant devastation, creating a death toll of more than 200, destroying several homes, and leaving thousands without electricity or water.</p>
<p>Yoshiki is no stranger to donating to causes or those in need. In the past, he&#8217;s supported campaigns to help relief and restoration efforts following hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico and earthquakes in Kumamoto and Tohoku, Japan. Most of his donations are made through his charitable organization Yoshiki Foundation America, which he originally established to support children who have lost family members to suicide.</p>
<p>Yoshiki tragically lost his father to suicide when he was a child. &#8220;I will continue to engage in charity activities as long as I am working as an artist,” he said.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Yoshiki’s <a href="http://www.yoshikifoundationamerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charitable works here</a>. To help the flood victims in Japan, visit the<a href="http://www.jrc.or.jp/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Japanese Red Cross website</a>.</p>

<p>Chris Thile, a four-time Grammy-winning artist and member of Punch Brothers and Nickel Creek, gave a rare solo performance on July 5 benefitting FLOW (For Love of Water), a nonprofit organization that works to protect the Great Lakes through use of public trust principles and an underpinning of science and technical analysis.</p>
<p>Guests on the grounds of the newly restored Cherry Basket Farm in Omena, MI were greeted with delicious cocktails and snacks before gathering inside a barn for the concert, which consisted of a broad range of Thile’s original tunes as well as impressive Radiohead and Bach covers interpreted on the mandolin.</p>
<p>Thile, who also hosts NPR’s popular radio show <em>Live From Here</em> (formerly known as <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>), spoke passionately about the importance of organizations like FLOW. &#8220;What organizations like FLOW are doing is considered to be among the most important work that humanity is doing, that we&#8217;re doing it is a testament to the ultimate goodness of humanity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Audience members were united in their love of both the Great Lakes and the music, and felt it was a powerful experience to see so many people coming together in the spirit of a good cause – protecting Michigan&#8217;s water – and watching Thile perform silhouetted against the setting sun with his mandolin.</p>

<p><em>By Jay Corliss </em></p>
<p>Since the world learned about thousands of immigrant children being separated from their parents at the US border as part of the new “zero tolerance” immigration policy, many people have been using their platforms to protest the executive order and advocate for the reunification of families who have been separated.</p>
<p>The music community has become particularly passionate about this issue as several musicians and record labels have expressed their outrage at the situation and mobilized their fanbases to take action. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bruce-springsteen-blasts-trumps-inhumane-border-policy/?mbid=social_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Springsteen even diverted from his usual setlist </a>to play “The Ghost of Tom Joad,&#8221; a song about giving a voice to the disenfranchised, and called out the &#8220;inhumane&#8221; policy.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ohboyrecords/status/1009538164573245442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh Boy Records</a> and Third Man Records encouraged their customers to donate to the cause through social media campaigns and by offering in-store incentives.</p>
<p>Also Common, Lauren Mayberry of CHVRCHES and others have posted links to show fans what actions they can take to support the families impacted by the immigration policy.</p>
<p>“The criminalization and separation of families immigrating to America is inhumane, cruel, and unacceptable,” Common said. “They should be embraced with compassion and love instead of hate and brutality.”</p>
<p>Mayberry encouraged her fans to donate to organizations working to keep families together.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the US on June 30 in “Families Belong Together” marches to protest the policy. Lin Manuel-Miranda, creator of the “Hamilton” hit musical, spoke and sang a lullaby he dedicated to parents who were not able to sing to their children.</p>

<p><em>By Jay Corliss</em></p>
<p>Jack White was recently presented with the key to Cincinnati by the city’s Mayor John Cranley in front of the historic King Records building. This event was held to honor the renowned rocker’s advocacy for music preservation and most importantly his support of King Records.</p>
<p>Opened in 1943, King Records quickly became a creative workspace and mecca for many notable musicians. James Brown recorded several hits at King, and it was there that he and Bootsy Collins began their musical collaboration. Despite its rich history, the building was set to be demolished, and it was only through extensive community efforts to secure its landmark status, vocal support from renowned musicians including Jack White and Bootsy Collins, and a recent deal and acquisition by the city of Cincinnati, that it is being preserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack White has been an unfailing supporter of King Records,&#8221; said Mayor Cranley. &#8220;Jack has actually covered Little Willie John&#8217;s song, ‘I&#8217;m Shakin&#8217;,’ which on the original recording our own Philip Paul played the drums, and he recently wore a King Records shirt in a cover story for Q Magazine.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JackWhite_Cincinatti2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5247" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JackWhite_Cincinatti2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JackWhite_Cincinatti2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JackWhite_Cincinatti2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JackWhite_Cincinatti2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JackWhite_Cincinatti2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Now that the building is safely in the hands of city, Evanston neighborhood president Anzora Adkins and the King Records Nonprofit Steering Committee have joined forces to work on plans to stabilize and revitalize the property. The committee includes leaders from  the Cincinnati USA Music Heritage Foundation, King Studios and the Bootsy Collins Foundation.</p>

<p><em>By Jay Corliss<br />
</em></p>
<p>Since the tragic school shooting in Parkland, FL last month, students from Parkland School and young people across the country have been advocating for stricter gun control laws and calling for an end to gun violence. Their movement, March For Our Lives, has generated many social media posts, walkouts, and debates about gun laws.</p>
<p>Now it seems that their efforts are inspiring musicians to take a stance on the issue. On March 2, Harry Styles tweeted his support by saying, &#8220;I just signed the @AMarch4OurLives petition, and you should too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The petition precedes the March For Our Lives event on March 24 and outlines the reforms that students will demand from lawmakers as they descend on Washington, DC and various state capitals.</p>
<p>Other musicians who have signed the petition include Hayley Williams from Paramore, St. Vincent, Justin Bieber, and Fifth Harmony&#8217;s Lauren Jauregui.</p>
<p>Recently, Sophie Hawley-Weld from emerging dance-pop duo Sofi Tukker also showed her support for the movement by rocking a March For Our Lives Sticker on her guitar strap during a <em>Conan</em> performance.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrRi1z8_59I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Rock band Incubus are also encouraging fans join the March for Our Lives event, and are offering the chance to win tickets to the upcoming In Bloom Festival in Houston and meet the band <a href="https://www.propeller.la/inbloom">via Propeller</a> by taking action and joining the movement to end gun violence in schools.</p>
<p>“As a band, we are so amazed and in awe of the young humans who have responded to the Parkland School shooting last month in Florida,” Incubus said in a statement. “We support you and we are so grateful for your courage and perseverance in organizing March For Our Lives and rallying the country to help end gun violence.”</p>

<p><em>by Rachel Komich</em></p>
<p>GIRLSCHOOL is back for the third year of its eponymous three-day festival featuring an impressive array of music, poetry, panels and workshops delivered by female-identifying artists. The stellar line-up includes Shirley Manson of Garbage with The GIRLSCHOOL Choir, Jay Som, Kristin Control and several special guests. The fest will take place February 2-4 at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles and begins with a keynote address by <em>Portlandia </em>creator and Sleater-Kinney front-woman Carrie Brownstein. The festival will also host poets Shauna Barbosa, Morgan Parker and more.</p>
<p>Founder Anna Bulbrook of Airborne Toxic Event, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and The Bulls, started the GIRlSCHOOL collective when she realized how few women were involved in the alternative music scene.</p>
<div id="attachment_5198" style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ANNA-BULBROOK-GIRLSCHOOL_8thNov_CharlottePatmore_21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5198 " src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ANNA-BULBROOK-GIRLSCHOOL_8thNov_CharlottePatmore_21-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="182" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">GIRLSCHOOL founder Anna Bulbrook. Photo: Charlotte Patmore</p></div>
<p>“I’d like girls to see that a happy and respectful community that includes people of all genders can come together to celebrate women’s artistry, listen to women’s voices, and have a really good time at a f–ing great music festival,” Bulbrook told us in an<a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/2016/12/girlschool-founder-dishes-on-festival-with-deap-vally-chelsea-wolfe-more-benefiting-girls-rock-camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> interview</a> before last year’s festival. What began as a residency at a local LA club turned into a full-fledged festival with the mission of creating a positive and inspiring creative space for a diverse community to celebrate female-created music and art.</p>
<p>A percentage of proceeds from the festival will go to <a href="http://www.writegirl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WriteGirl</a>, a creative writing and mentoring nonprofit organization that promotes creativity, critical thinking and leadership skills to empower teen girls.</p>

<p><em>By Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>The inaugural Responsible Business Summit West took place in San Francisco November 14-15, bringing together top business leaders, nonprofits, think tanks and academics to discuss issues surrounding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and ethical business practices.</p>
<p>Among the attendees were brands including Timberland, Google, HP, Levi Strauss, Facebook, Hanesbrands and Target, and nonprofits including United Way, World Vision, Project Wet Foundation, the UN Global Compact and more. The conference, which was organized by the UK-based organization <a href="http://www.ethicalcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethical Corp</a>, tackled important issues including the business value of social impact, how to scale up social impact through partner collaborations, leveraging social purpose as a recruitment tool, and how to realign established businesses around social impact and making it an integral part of their missions.</p>
<p>On Day 1, a compelling panel on how to effectively educate colleagues about the value of CSR brought together reps from Google, Intuit, and Edelman public relations. Diane Wakeley Solinger, Director of Google.org, said that Google is investing $1 billion in three major social good areas: education, economic opportunity, and inclusion and social justice. Google is providing funding, volunteers and tools to innovative nonprofits to help them further their work, and this is a key pillar of Google’s business. Solinger admitted that it can be challenging to bring Google’s 80,000 employees along on this journey and to get everyone to feel a part of the social mission. She added that Google would welcome the opportunity to collaborate with other tech companies on social good initiatives to broaden their impact. “We go insular too often,” she said.</p>
<p>John D. Edelman explained that Edelman is also “on a journey to embed corporate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do.” In order to do so most effectively, the global PR and marketing firm did a survey to find out which <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Development Goals</a> its employees cared about most, and is targeting its social good efforts to address those issues.</p>
<p>Another compelling panel examined the very important business value of social purpose. HP’s Director of Human Rights and Supply Chain Responsibility Annukka Dickens explained how HP is working across industry borders to make an impact, and showed a video about a program that HP implemented to buy recycled plastics from Haiti to make its printer cartridges while also helping local Haitians to earn money by collecting plastic bottles for recycling and transforming waste into useful products, making it a win-win for everyone involved. Watch the video below:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibSkbHetqvY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Zendesk’s VP of Social Impact Tiffany Apczynski said that she hopes CSR departments will be on par with other key operational departments like Human Resources at companies going forward, and mentioned that it has been proven that CSR is closely linked with employee contentment.</p>
<p>On the second day of the conference, an External Keynote discussion about the need for businesses to go beyond compliance was delivered by Michael Kobori, Vice President of Sustainability for Levi Strauss, and Marcel Jacobs, Director of Supplier Sustainability for Philips Group.</p>
<p><span id="more-5172"></span></p>
<p>Kobori explained that when Levi Strauss established supply chain compliance standards to make sure its materials were ethically sourced and workers were treated fairly 25 years ago, several naysayers told them they were crazy and that the business would never survive. “People laughed at us,” he said. “They said it was impossible and it would destroy our supply chain. Flash forward to 2011, and what used to be the ceiling [in supply chain compliance] is now the floor.”</p>
<p>Kobori and Jacobs both admitted that there are many challenges when policing supply chains, such as suppliers that falsify records, but Jacobs explained that it can be reframed as a benefit both the supplier and the buyer when done right. “At first, suppliers saw compliance as a hurdle, but now they see it as a way to strengthen their relationship with us,” Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon during the Millennial Keynote discussion, students from UC Berkeley and the University of San Francisco spoke about which employer attributes are most important to them when looking for a job, shedding more light on this for many of the brands in attendance. “We want to work for companies whose values show in what they do,” said Shoka Marefat, a student at the University of San Francisco, who added that companies that “walk the walk” and don’t just “talk the talk” are most appealing to her. “We’re attracted to companies that value CSR enough to pay top dollar for it and give it as much importance as other operations departments,” added Laura Elstein, a Berkeley student.</p>
<p>The final panel of the conference addressed how to quantify the impact of CSR on businesses’ commercial success. Chris Fox, VP of Corporate Social Responsibility at Hanesbrands Inc, said that employee turnover rates have decreased by approximately 30 percent, largely as a result of his company’s CSR efforts and resulting increased employee satisfaction, saving the company millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Melodie Kinet, Director of Business Development at Samasource, emphasized the importance of storytelling and sharing the stories of the social impact that a company’s initiatives are having with consumers, stakeholders and employees. “It’s really all about storytelling,” Kinet said. “The market is starting to demand this. If you’re not doing it, you’re going to be left behind.”</p>
<p>Fox concurred, and said that Hanesbrands is aspiring to do more storytelling behind the clothing company’s social good efforts. “Things are going on underneath the bedcovers and we don’t talk about it enough,” he said. “It’s the core of our business and consumers are becoming more aware of it. We won’t be left behind.”</p>

<p><em> </em><em>By Rachel Komich &amp;<br />
Laura Ferreiro</em></p>
<p>Ed Sheeran, Nick Jonas, The Breeders, Iron and Wine, Vance Joy and several other musicians are back for the fourth annual Bedstock – a virtual music festival in which artists perform from their beds to raise funds and awareness for kids fighting cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. The artists are playing music from their beds in solidarity with seriously ill kids who have to spend their holiday season in hospital beds. Approximately 100 artists are taking part in this virtual festival to raise money for MyMusicRx, the &#8220;music as medicine” program affiliated with the <a href="https://joyrx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children’s Cancer Association</a> (CCA).</p>
<div id="attachment_5161" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ed-Sheeran.png"><img class="wp-image-5161 size-large" src="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ed-Sheeran-1024x548.png" alt="" width="600" height="321" srcset="http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ed-Sheeran-1024x548.png 1024w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ed-Sheeran-300x160.png 300w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ed-Sheeran-768x411.png 768w, http://www.rubymix.ml/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ed-Sheeran.png 1402w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ed Sheeran performs from his bed for Bedstock 2017</p></div>
<p>This year’s theme is “Bigger and BEDDER,” due to the addition of a new inclusive feature that asks the audience for their participation. With the hashtag #BedStockChallenge, anyone can be part of Bedstock by adding their own performance to social media and encouraging their friends to do the same.</p>
<p>“Bedstock is an incredible showcase for the kids we have the privilege to serve and for our passionate belief that joy matters and music heals,” said Regina Ellis, founder and CEO of CCA. “By literally playing from bed, artists and their fans can join MyMusicRx in making a difference right now in the lives of children and teens in the fight of their lives against cancer and other devastating diagnoses.”</p>
<p>Over the past four years, artists including Jack Johnson, Panic! At the Disco, Moby, Norah Jones, Tegan and Sara, Jim James, X Ambassadors, The Decembrists, Lucius, and BøRNS have all gotten cozy for Bedstock and helped raise more than $95,000 to continue MyMusicRx’s mission of providing bedside and online music medicine programs nationwide through 25 pediatric hospitals. The program began more than 20 years ago with a vision to bring joy and stress-relief to patients of all ages and diagnoses through music.</p>

<p>“I’m excited to be performing from bed for Bedstock this year and hope that my fans and social followers will join me in supporting such an amazing cause,” said Jonas. “To play in bed for hospitalized kids who can’t get out of theirs is an incredible honor that I am proud to be a part of.”</p>
<p>Event sponsors and partners include Nike, Atlantic Records, Ace Hotel, Pandora, Sonos, Stumptown Coffee Roasters, and more.</p>

<p>A benefit concert will be held next month to help the victims of the recent Las Vegas shooting massacre. The benefit will be held December 1 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and will be headlined by Las Vegas natives The Killers and Imagine Dragons. Other performers include Boyz II Men, Cirque de Soleil performers, Penn and Teller, magician David Copperfield, and more that will be announced soon.</p>
<p>The benefit concert will aid people impacted by the tragic shooting, which took place October 1 in which a gunman shot and killed 58 people and injured more than 500 others at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas strip before killing himself.</p>
<p>Tickets are available <a href="https://www.axs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and range from $75 to $125. Proceeds will go towards benefitting the Las Vegas Victims Fund. If you want to help in other ways, you can donate to the National Compassion Fund by texting VEGAS to 20222 to give $10. Your donation will go directly towards those who were affected by the Las Vegas shooting.</p>
